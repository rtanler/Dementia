## Overview

This is an AI-generated intelligent textbook on dementia and cognitive decline designed for patients, caregivers, families, and healthcare professionals without specialized dementia training. Built using MkDocs with the Material theme, it incorporates a comprehensive learning graph with 200 interconnected concepts, interactive visualizations, and evidence-based content generation.

The guidebook follows Bloom's Taxonomy (2001 revision) for learning outcomes and uses concept dependency graphs to ensure proper prerequisite sequencing. Written at a 9th-10th grade reading level, it makes complex medical concepts accessible through clear language, diagrams, and real-world examples. All content is generated and curated using Claude AI and Claude Skills, making it a modern, AI-assisted educational resource.

Whether you're a patient newly diagnosed with dementia, a family member becoming a caregiver, or a healthcare provider seeking structured educational materials, this guidebook provides comprehensive coverage from basic neuroscience to practical daily care strategies, legal planning, and emotional support resources.

## Kanban Board for Book Task Status

We track the status of book development tasks on a GitHub Projects Kanban board:

**[https://github.com/users/dmccreary/projects/10/](https://github.com/users/dmccreary/projects/10/)**

The board uses the following columns to organize work:

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Backlog** | Tasks that have been identified but not yet started. New ideas, planned chapters, MicroSims, or improvements get added here while they wait to be prioritized. |
| **Ready** | Tasks that have been refined, prioritized, and are ready to be picked up. The scope is clear enough that work can begin without further clarification. |
| **In progress** | Tasks that are actively being worked on. Content is being drafted, code is being written, or a MicroSim is being built. |
| **In review** | Tasks where the work is complete and is being reviewed for accuracy, readability, accessibility, or technical quality before being marked done. |
| **Done** | Tasks that have been completed, reviewed, and merged or published to the live site. |

In addition to the status columns, each task can be tagged with a **Priority** and a **Size** to help with planning and triage:

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **P0** | Critical — must be addressed immediately. Blocks the site, breaks the build, or corrects a serious content error. |
| **P1** | High — important work that should be done in the current development cycle. |
| **P2** | Normal — useful improvements and enhancements that can be scheduled when capacity allows. |

| Size | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **XS** | Trivial — a quick fix such as a typo, link correction, or small wording change. |
| **S**  | Small — a focused change that touches one file or a single concept. |
| **M**  | Medium — a moderate task such as drafting a short chapter section or building a simple MicroSim. |
| **L**  | Large — a significant task such as writing a full chapter or building a complex MicroSim. |
| **XL** | Extra large — a multi-step initiative that may need to be broken into smaller tasks before work begins. |

## Site Status and Metrics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Concepts in Learning Graph** | 200 |
| **Foundational Concepts** | 4 |
| **Taxonomy Categories** | 12 |
| **Average Dependencies per Concept** | 1.25 |
| **Maximum Learning Path Length** | 8 |
| **Markdown Files** | 19 |
| **Total Words** | ~6,500 |
| **Interactive MicroSims** | 2 |
| **Glossary Terms** | In development |
| **FAQ Questions** | In development |
| **Chapter Content** | In development |

**Completion Status:** Learning graph and foundational structure complete (~25%). Chapter content generation in progress.

**Learning Graph Quality Score:** The concept dependency graph has been validated as a proper Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with no circular dependencies, ensuring learners encounter concepts in the correct order.

## Development Workflow

### Learning Graph Updates

If you modify the learning graph:

1. Edit `docs/learning-graph/learning-graph.csv` with concept changes
2. Run validation: `python docs/learning-graph/validate-learning-graph.py`
3. Add taxonomy: `python docs/learning-graph/add-taxonomy.py`
4. Convert to JSON: `python docs/learning-graph/csv-to-json.py`
5. Analyze quality: `python docs/learning-graph/analyze-graph.py`
6. Generate distribution: `python docs/learning-graph/taxonomy-distribution.py`

Or use the automated validation script:

```bash
cd docs/learning-graph
./validate-learning-graph.sh
```
