# Chapter 10: Therapeutic Interventions

## Introduction

While medications play a role in managing dementia symptoms, non-pharmacological therapeutic interventions are equally—and sometimes more—effective in improving quality of life, maintaining function, and addressing behavioral symptoms. These therapies offer person-centered approaches that engage individuals with dementia in meaningful activities, preserve dignity, and support emotional well-being.

Therapeutic interventions for dementia fall into several categories:

- **Professional therapies**: Cognitive stimulation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy delivered by trained professionals
- **Expressive therapies**: Music therapy and art therapy that engage creative abilities
- **Psychological approaches**: Reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, and reality orientation
- **Sensory therapies**: Sensory stimulation, aromatherapy, and massage therapy
- **Animal-assisted therapy**: Pet therapy that provides companionship and engagement

**Key Principle**: The best interventions are individualized, based on the person's interests, abilities, cultural background, and stage of dementia. What works for one person may not work for another.

This chapter explores 13 evidence-based therapeutic interventions, providing practical guidance for families and caregivers on how these therapies work, their benefits, and how to access or implement them.

## Professional Therapeutic Interventions

### Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST)

Cognitive Stimulation Therapy is a structured, evidence-based intervention designed to engage and stimulate cognitive abilities through themed activities and discussions.

#### What is CST?

CST is a brief psychological treatment for people with mild to moderate dementia. It involves:

- **Group sessions** (typically 4-6 participants) led by trained facilitators
- **Twice-weekly sessions** lasting 45 minutes
- **7-week program** covering 14 sessions
- **Themed activities** including word games, current affairs discussion, categorization tasks, and creative activities
- **Reality orientation** components (date, time, location)
- **Social interaction** and reminiscence elements

#### Core Principles

CST is based on several key principles:

1. **Mental stimulation**: Activities challenge thinking without being too difficult
2. **Person-centered approach**: Respects individual preferences and experiences
3. **Implicit learning**: Learning occurs naturally through activity rather than testing
4. **Social engagement**: Group format provides social connection
5. **Choice and control**: Participants have choices within activities
6. **Respect**: Focus on opinions rather than facts; no right or wrong answers

#### Evidence Base

Research demonstrates that CST:

- **Improves cognition** comparably to cholinesterase inhibitors
- **Enhances quality of life** for people with dementia
- **Improves communication** and social interaction
- **May delay cognitive decline** when continued as maintenance CST
- **Cost-effective** compared to pharmacological interventions

#### Practical Application

**Sample CST Session Structure**:

1. **Welcome and orientation** (5 minutes): Discuss date, weather, current events
2. **Warm-up activity** (5 minutes): Simple game or song
3. **Main activity** (30 minutes): Themed activity (e.g., categorizing household items, discussing famous faces, creative word games)
4. **Closing** (5 minutes): Summary and preview of next session

**Themes Used in CST**:

- Physical games (balloon toss, adapted ball games)
- Sounds and music
- Childhood memories
- Food discussions
- Current affairs
- Faces and scenes (recognizing famous people/places)
- Word games and associations
- Creative activities (art, poetry)
- Using objects (categorization, discussion)
- Number games

**Tips for Success**:

- Create a **stimulating environment**: Use colorful materials, varied activities
- Encourage **opinion sharing** rather than testing memory
- Use **multi-sensory approaches**: Visual, auditory, tactile elements
- Provide **gentle challenges**: Activities should be engaging but not frustrating
- Foster **group cohesion**: Encourage participants to help each other

#### Access and Training

- Some memory clinics and day programs offer CST
- CST training manuals are available for facilitators
- Can be adapted for one-on-one use with family members
- Online resources and videos demonstrate session structures

### Occupational Therapy

Occupational therapy (OT) helps people with dementia maintain independence in daily activities and adapt to functional changes.

#### Role of Occupational Therapy

OT focuses on:

- **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)**: Bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting, eating
- **Instrumental ADLs (IADLs)**: Cooking, shopping, managing finances, housework
- **Meaningful activities**: Hobbies, social participation, leisure activities
- **Environmental modifications**: Making homes safer and easier to navigate
- **Caregiver training**: Teaching strategies to support independence

#### Key OT Interventions

**1. Task Breakdown and Simplification**

OTs analyze complex tasks and break them into manageable steps.

*Example - Getting Dressed*:

- Lay out clothes in order of use
- Use clothes with easy fasteners (Velcro, elastic waists)
- Provide one item at a time with verbal cues
- Allow extra time without rushing

**2. Environmental Adaptations**

- **Visual cues**: Labels with pictures, color-coded drawers
- **Safety modifications**: Remove tripping hazards, improve lighting
- **Simplified spaces**: Reduce clutter, organize items logically
- **Contrast**: Use contrasting colors (e.g., white toilet seat on dark floor)

**3. Compensatory Strategies**

- **Memory aids**: Calendars, clocks, reminder notes, pill organizers
- **Routine establishment**: Consistent daily schedules
- **Assistive devices**: Adapted utensils, grab bars, shower chairs

**4. Sensory-Based Interventions**

- **Activity boxes**: Containers with items related to past occupations or interests (e.g., tools for former carpenter, sewing supplies for seamstress)
- **Fidget items**: Textured objects, busy boards for restless hands
- **Sensory rooms**: Spaces with calming or stimulating sensory experiences

#### Benefits of OT

- **Maintains independence** longer
- **Reduces caregiver burden** by teaching effective strategies
- **Prevents safety incidents** through home modifications
- **Supports meaningful engagement** in valued activities
- **Addresses behavioral symptoms** through activity and sensory approaches

#### When to Seek OT

Consider OT referral when:

- Person is having difficulty with daily activities
- Safety concerns arise (falls, wandering, kitchen safety)
- Behavioral symptoms emerge (agitation, restlessness)
- Caregiver needs guidance on supportive strategies
- Preparing for transitions (moving to assisted living, increased care needs)

### Physical Therapy

Physical therapy (PT) addresses mobility, strength, balance, and functional movement in people with dementia.

#### Goals of Physical Therapy

- **Prevent falls** and maintain balance
- **Preserve mobility** and independence
- **Manage pain** from arthritis or other conditions
- **Maintain strength** and endurance
- **Support safe transfers** (bed to chair, in/out of car)

#### Common PT Interventions

**1. Balance Training**

Balance exercises reduce fall risk:

- Standing on one foot (with support)
- Heel-to-toe walking
- Weight shifting exercises
- Tai Chi (adapted for cognitive abilities)

**2. Strengthening Exercises**

Maintaining muscle strength supports daily function:

- Sit-to-stand exercises from chair
- Leg lifts while sitting or lying down
- Arm exercises with light weights or resistance bands
- Core strengthening for stability

**3. Gait Training**

Improving walking pattern and safety:

- Practice with assistive devices (walker, cane)
- Walking over obstacles
- Turning and navigating doorways safely
- Stair climbing practice

**4. Range of Motion**

Preventing stiffness and contractures:

- Gentle stretching exercises
- Active and passive range of motion
- Morning routines to reduce stiffness

**5. Functional Training**

Practicing real-life activities:

- Getting in/out of bed safely
- Transferring to/from toilet
- Navigating home environment
- Managing outdoor terrain

#### Exercise Programs for Dementia

Research supports several exercise approaches:

**Aerobic Exercise**:

- Walking programs (indoor or outdoor)
- Stationary cycling
- Water aerobics (low-impact, safe)
- Dance (cognitive + physical benefits)

**Multimodal Programs**:

Combining aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility training shows the greatest benefits for:

- Cognitive function
- Physical function
- Behavioral symptoms
- Quality of life

**Recommended Frequency**: 2-3 times per week, 30-60 minutes per session

#### Adaptations for Dementia

PTs adapt exercises for cognitive limitations:

- **Simple, one-step instructions**: "Lift your arm"
- **Demonstration**: Show rather than just tell
- **Repetition**: Practice same exercises consistently
- **Music**: Use familiar songs to cue movements
- **Functional context**: Frame exercises as daily tasks (reaching for dishes = shoulder stretch)

### Speech Therapy (Speech-Language Pathology)

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address communication and swallowing difficulties in people with dementia.

#### Communication Support

SLPs help with:

**1. Expressive Communication** (difficulty speaking)

- Word-finding strategies
- Alternative communication methods (gestures, pictures)
- Reducing frustration related to communication breakdowns

**2. Receptive Communication** (difficulty understanding)

- Teaching caregivers to simplify language
- Using visual supports
- Checking comprehension strategies

**3. Pragmatic Communication** (social use of language)

- Turn-taking in conversation
- Staying on topic
- Social appropriateness

#### Strategies SLPs Teach Caregivers

**Communication Techniques**:

- **Simplify language**: Use short sentences, one idea at a time
- **Speak slowly**: Allow processing time
- **Use nonverbal cues**: Gestures, facial expressions, touch
- **Reduce distractions**: Turn off TV, minimize background noise
- **Offer choices**: Show objects rather than asking open-ended questions
- **Validate feelings**: Even if words don't make sense, acknowledge emotions

**For Word-Finding Difficulties**:

- Wait patiently; don't rush
- Offer first sound of word as a cue
- Suggest category (Is it a food? A place?)
- Accept pointing or gestures
- Redirect if frustration builds

#### Swallowing (Dysphagia) Management

In later stages, dementia affects swallowing. SLPs assess and manage:

**Signs of Swallowing Problems**:

- Coughing or choking during meals
- Pocketing food in cheeks
- Taking a long time to eat
- Weight loss
- Recurrent pneumonia (aspiration risk)

**Interventions**:

1. **Diet modifications**:
   - Thickened liquids (thin, nectar-thick, honey-thick, pudding-thick)
   - Texture modifications (pureed, minced, soft)

2. **Positioning**:
   - Upright at 90 degrees for meals
   - Chin tuck position to protect airway
   - Remain upright 30 minutes after eating

3. **Eating strategies**:
   - Smaller bites
   - Slower pace
   - Alternate solids and liquids
   - Remind to swallow

4. **Oral care**:
   - Mouth care before and after meals
   - Check for pocketed food

**Safety Consideration**: Aspiration pneumonia (food/liquid entering lungs) is a serious complication. SLPs conduct swallow studies to determine safest diet consistency.

#### When to Seek SLP Services

- Communication becoming difficult
- Noticeable decline in conversation ability
- Concerns about eating/swallowing
- Choking incidents
- Unexplained weight loss

## Expressive and Creative Therapies

### Music Therapy

Music therapy uses music interventions to address physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of people with dementia.

#### Why Music Works for Dementia

Music has unique effects on the brain:

- **Preserved musical memory**: Musical memories often remain intact even in advanced dementia
- **Emotional connection**: Music evokes emotions and memories
- **Rhythmic entrainment**: Rhythm can facilitate movement and speech
- **Whole-brain activation**: Music engages multiple brain regions
- **Autobiographical connection**: Songs from youth trigger personal memories

#### Types of Music Therapy Interventions

**1. Active Music Making**

Participants create music:

- **Singing**: Group sing-alongs, solo singing, humming
- **Instrument playing**: Percussion instruments (drums, tambourines, shakers), xylophones, tone bells
- **Movement to music**: Dancing, clapping, rhythmic motion
- **Music improvisation**: Creating spontaneous music

**2. Receptive Music Listening**

Listening to selected music:

- **Personalized playlists**: Music from person's youth (typically ages 15-25)
- **Relaxation music**: For reducing agitation or promoting sleep
- **Lyric discussion**: Talking about song meanings and memories

**3. Songwriting and Music Reminiscence**

- Creating new songs about life experiences
- Using familiar songs as memory prompts
- Adapting song lyrics to personal stories

#### Benefits of Music Therapy

Research shows music therapy can:

- **Reduce agitation and behavioral symptoms**
- **Decrease anxiety and depression**
- **Improve mood and emotional expression**
- **Enhance social interaction and participation**
- **Stimulate movement** in those with motor impairments
- **Support verbal communication** (singing may be easier than speaking)
- **Provide cognitive stimulation** through lyric recall
- **Offer meaningful engagement** and joy

#### Practical Music Interventions for Families

**Creating Personalized Playlists**:

1. **Identify meaningful music**: Ask family about favorite songs, genres, artists from youth
2. **Consider cultural background**: Include traditional or culturally significant music
3. **Note responses**: Observe which songs elicit positive reactions
4. **Organize by purpose**:
   - Morning wake-up music (upbeat)
   - Calming music for agitation
   - Music for meals (moderate tempo)
   - Bedtime relaxation music

**Implementing Music at Home**:

- Use during **difficult care tasks** (bathing, dressing) to reduce resistance
- Play during **sundowning hours** to reduce agitation
- Create **singing routines** (sing while brushing teeth, getting dressed)
- Attend **community music programs** or dementia-friendly concerts
- Use music to **facilitate movement** (dancing, walking)

**Considerations**:

- Avoid **overstimulation**: Music should be at comfortable volume
- Watch for **negative reactions**: Some music may evoke sad memories or agitation
- **Individual preferences matter**: Not everyone enjoys the same music
- **Live music** often works better than recordings
- **Simple instruments** can be more engaging than passive listening

#### Resources

- Certified music therapists (MT-BC credential)

### Art Therapy

Art therapy uses creative art-making to support emotional expression, cognitive engagement, and social connection in people with dementia.

#### Benefits of Art Therapy

Art therapy offers unique advantages:

- **Nonverbal expression**: Communicate feelings without words
- **Process-oriented**: Focus on creating, not the end product
- **Success-oriented**: No right or wrong in art
- **Sensory engagement**: Tactile and visual stimulation
- **Preserves identity**: Connects with creative self
- **Reduces isolation**: Group art builds community
- **Provides control**: Choice in colors, materials, techniques
- **Cognitive stimulation**: Planning, problem-solving, decision-making

#### Types of Art Activities

**1. Painting and Drawing**

- **Watercolors**: Forgiving medium, blending effects
- **Acrylics**: Vibrant colors, quick-drying
- **Pastels and crayons**: Easy to hold and use
- **Collage**: Tearing and gluing, less skill-dependent

**2. Sculpture and Tactile Art**

- **Clay modeling**: Sensory, no artistic skill needed
- **Playdough**: Familiar, safe material
- **Assemblage**: Creating 3D art from found objects

**3. Group Art Projects**

- **Collaborative murals**: Each person contributes
- **Seasonal crafts**: Holiday decorations, cards
- **Memory books**: Photos and drawings about life

**4. Observation and Discussion**

- **Museum visits**: Dementia-friendly museum programs
- **Art appreciation**: Discussing famous artworks
- **Nature observation**: Drawing or painting from nature

#### Adaptations for Dementia

**Environmental Adaptations**:

- **Simplified choices**: Offer 2-3 colors rather than full palette
- **Prepared materials**: Set up workspace to reduce confusion
- **Protective covering**: Plastic tablecloths, aprons
- **Good lighting**: Bright, non-glare light
- **Comfortable seating**: Stable chairs at appropriate height

**Process Adaptations**:

- **Simplify steps**: One instruction at a time
- **Demonstrate**: Show how to use materials
- **Emphasize process**: "Enjoy the colors" not "Make a picture of X"
- **Accept all outcomes**: Praise effort and enjoyment
- **Avoid correction**: No wrong way to create
- **Allow time**: Don't rush the creative process

**Material Considerations**:

- **Non-toxic**: All materials should be safe if accidentally ingested
- **Easy to manipulate**: Large brushes, chunky crayons
- **Washable**: Choose materials that clean up easily
- **Familiar**: Sometimes familiar materials (crayons) work better than unfamiliar ones (spray paint)

#### Therapeutic Approach

Art therapy is about the **process, not the product**:

- **Focus on engagement**: Is the person enjoying the activity?
- **Support autonomy**: Offer choices and respect decisions
- **Interpret positively**: "I see you used bright, happy colors"
- **Use art for communication**: "Tell me about what you're creating"
- **Respect emotional expression**: Art may reveal feelings

#### When Art May Not Work

Some individuals with dementia may:

- Find art frustrating if they had high artistic standards
- Become upset if their abilities have declined significantly
- Prefer other forms of engagement (music, conversation, physical activity)

**Respect individual preferences**—not every intervention works for everyone.

## Psychological and Cognitive Approaches

### Reminiscence Therapy

Reminiscence therapy uses discussion of past experiences and memories to improve mood, cognition, and communication in people with dementia.

#### Basis of Reminiscence Therapy

The approach is based on:

- **Preserved remote memory**: Older memories often remain intact longer than recent ones
- **Sense of identity**: Recalling life story reinforces who the person is
- **Positive emotions**: Happy memories boost mood
- **Social connection**: Sharing memories builds relationships
- **Cognitive stimulation**: Remembering engages cognitive processes

#### Types of Reminiscence Work

**1. Simple Reminiscence**

Informal conversations about the past:

- Looking at old photos
- Discussing historical events ("Where were you when Kennedy was assassinated?")
- Talking about childhood, school, first job, marriage
- Sharing family stories

**2. Life Review**

More structured, chronological review of life:

- Creating life story books or memory boxes
- Recording oral histories
- Mapping life timeline with major events
- Legacy projects (letters to grandchildren, recorded memories)

**3. Specific Reminiscence**

Focused on particular themes:

- Occupational reminiscence (discussing career/work)
- Cultural reminiscence (traditions, holidays)
- Sensory reminiscence (smells, tastes, textures from past)

#### Reminiscence Triggers

**Visual Triggers**:

- Photographs (family, historical events, childhood home)
- Old magazines, newspapers, catalogs
- Historical pictures (fashion, cars, home appliances from their era)
- Maps of childhood neighborhoods

**Auditory Triggers**:

- Music from youth
- Historical radio broadcasts
- Recordings of old TV shows or commercials
- Sounds (train whistle, church bells)

**Olfactory Triggers**:

- Familiar scents (coffee, baking bread, flowers, perfume)
- Cultural foods
- Nature smells (cut grass, rain)

**Tactile Triggers**:

- Objects from the past (old tools, kitchen items, toys)
- Fabrics (fur, velvet, wool)
- Texture boxes with varied materials

**Taste Triggers**:

- Favorite foods from childhood
- Traditional recipes
- Regional or ethnic foods

#### Conducting Reminiscence Sessions

**Structure**:

1. **Choose a theme**: "School days," "First job," "Holidays," "Courtship and marriage"
2. **Introduce trigger**: Show photo, play song, pass around object
3. **Invite sharing**: "What does this remind you of?"
4. **Facilitate discussion**: Ask open-ended questions, allow time for processing
5. **Validate and connect**: "That sounds like a wonderful memory," relate one person's memory to another's

**Effective Questions**:

- "Tell me about your childhood home"
- "What was your favorite subject in school?"
- "What was your wedding day like?"
- "What kind of work did you do?"
- "What did you do for fun when you were young?"

**Tips for Success**:

- **Accept memory inaccuracies**: Don't correct details; focus on feelings
- **Support non-talkers**: Use yes/no questions, allow listening without participating
- **Watch for distress**: Some memories may be painful; shift topic if upset
- **Include all**: In group settings, ensure everyone has opportunity to share
- **Document memories**: Write down or record stories for preservation

#### Creating Memory Boxes and Life Story Books

**Memory Box Contents**:

- Photographs from different life stages
- Small meaningful objects (jewelry, tools, sports items)
- Certificates, awards, programs from events
- Letters, cards, postcards
- Fabric swatches (from wedding dress, military uniform)
- Cultural or religious items

**Life Story Book Structure**:

- Childhood and family background
- School years
- Young adulthood and career
- Marriage and family
- Hobbies and interests
- Significant life events
- Values and beliefs

**Uses**:

- Conversation starter with family and caregivers
- Identity reinforcement
- Communication tool for new caregivers
- Legacy for family members

#### Benefits of Reminiscence Therapy

- **Improves mood and reduces depression**
- **Enhances communication** and social engagement
- **Stimulates cognition** through memory recall
- **Strengthens relationships** between person and caregivers
- **Provides pleasure** and meaningful activity
- **Maintains sense of identity and self-worth**
- **Creates legacy** for family

### Validation Therapy

Validation therapy, developed by Naomi Feil, is a communication approach that validates the emotions and reality of people with dementia rather than correcting or reorienting them.

#### Core Principles

Validation therapy is based on several key beliefs:

1. **All behavior has meaning**: Behaviors are attempts to communicate needs or emotions
2. **Respect and empathy**: Accept the person's reality without judgment
3. **Never argue**: Don't contradict or try to convince them they're wrong
4. **Validate feelings**: Acknowledge the emotions behind the words
5. **Use past coping strategies**: Help access ways they've handled stress before

#### Validation Techniques

**1. Centering**

Before interacting, caregivers center themselves:

- Take deep breaths
- Set aside own stress and agenda
- Approach with empathy and genuine interest
- Make eye contact at person's level

**2. Factual Questions**

Use gentle questions to understand:

- "Who?" "What?" "Where?" "When?" "How?"
- Avoid "Why?" (can sound accusatory)
- *Example*: Person says "I need to go home." Ask "What was your home like?" rather than "You are home."

**3. Rephrasing**

Repeat key words to show you're listening:

- **Person**: "I have to pick up my children from school."
- **Caregiver**: "You're worried about your children."
- **Person**: "Yes, they'll be waiting for me."
- **Caregiver**: "You love your children very much."

**4. Using Polarity**

Explore the extreme:

- **Person**: "My mother never loved me."
- **Caregiver**: "Never? Not even once?"
- Often prompts recall of positive memory

**5. Reminiscing**

Use the false belief as a doorway to memory:

- **Person**: "I need to go to work."
- **Caregiver**: "What kind of work did you do?" (shifts to reminiscence about career)

**6. Maintaining Genuine Close Eye Contact**

Eye contact communicates:

- "I see you"
- "You matter"
- "I'm fully present with you"

Position yourself at eye level (sit if they're sitting).

**7. Using Ambiguity**

Respond without confirming or denying:

- **Person**: "Have you seen my mother?" (deceased)
- **Caregiver**: "Tell me about your mother. What was she like?"
- Allows expression without lying or correcting

**8. Matching and Mirroring**

- Match emotional tone (if sad, respond with gentle empathy)
- Mirror body language subtly
- Use similar speech pace and volume

**9. Using Touch**

- Appropriate touch can calm and connect
- Hold hand, pat shoulder, gentle hug
- Watch for acceptance (some people don't like touch)

**10. Music**

Use preferred music to:

- Calm agitation
- Connect emotionally
- Facilitate communication

#### Validation vs. Reality Orientation

**Reality Orientation** (older approach):

- Corrects misperceptions: "Your mother died 20 years ago"
- Uses repeated orientation: "Today is Tuesday, you're in the nursing home"
- Can cause distress, argument, feelings of loss

**Validation Therapy**:

- Accepts person's reality: "You miss your mother"
- Focuses on feelings: "It sounds like you want to see her"
- Reduces distress by validating emotions

**When to Use Reality Orientation**: Early stages when person can benefit from factual information and memory supports. As dementia progresses, validation becomes more appropriate.

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: "I Need to Go Home"**

- **Don't say**: "You are home!" or "You live here now."
- **Instead**: "What was your home like?" or "You miss your home. Tell me about it."

**Example 2: "Someone Stole My Purse"**

- **Don't say**: "No one stole it. It's right here."
- **Instead**: "You're worried about your purse. It's important to you. What do you keep in it?" (while helping look)

**Example 3: "I Have to Pick Up My Children"**

- **Don't say**: "Your children are adults now."
- **Instead**: "You're a devoted mother. Tell me about your children. What were they like when they were young?"

**Example 4: Mother Confusion**

- **Don't say**: "I'm not your mother. I'm your daughter."
- **Instead**: "You're looking for your mother. You must miss her. What was she like?"

#### Benefits of Validation Therapy

- **Reduces agitation and anxiety**
- **Decreases catastrophic reactions**
- **Improves caregiver-patient relationships**
- **Maintains dignity and self-worth**
- **Provides emotional comfort**
- **Reduces need for psychotropic medications**

**Key Message**: Meet the person where they are, not where you want them to be.

### Reality Orientation

Reality orientation (RO) is a therapeutic approach that provides consistent information about time, place, and person to reduce confusion and support cognitive function.

#### What is Reality Orientation?

RO involves regularly presenting orientation information:

- **Time**: Date, day of week, season, time of day
- **Place**: Location, room, building
- **Person**: Name, age, family relationships
- **Situation**: Current activities, upcoming events

#### Two Types of Reality Orientation

**1. 24-Hour Reality Orientation**

Informal, ongoing approach integrated into daily care:

- **Greetings include orientation**: "Good morning, Mom. It's Tuesday, April 15th. We're at your home."
- **Conversations reference time/place**: "After breakfast, your daughter is visiting."
- **Environmental cues**: Clocks, calendars, signs, labels
- **Consistent routines**: Same activities at same times

**2. Classroom Reality Orientation**

Structured group sessions (less commonly used now):

- Formal classes with orientation information
- Discussion of current events
- Practice with orientation boards

**Modern Use**: 24-hour RO is more commonly used than classroom RO; it's gentler and more person-centered.

#### Reality Orientation Techniques

**Environmental Modifications**:

- **Large, clear clocks**: Digital clocks showing day and date
- **Calendars**: Mark off days, highlight events
- **Signs and labels**: "Bathroom," "Kitchen," with pictures
- **Color coding**: Different colors for different rooms
- **Photo labels**: Pictures on drawers, cabinets
- **Memory boards**: "Today is ___. The weather is ___."

**Communication Techniques**:

- **Natural orientation cues**: "It's getting dark out—that means it's evening"
- **Gentle reminders**: "We just had breakfast, so it's morning"
- **Contextual information**: "Your daughter Sarah is coming at 2 PM today"
- **Repetition without frustration**: Calmly re-orient as often as needed

**Activity-Based Orientation**:

- Discuss current events during meals
- Talk about seasonal activities
- Review family photos with names
- Use the day's newspaper

#### When Reality Orientation is Appropriate

**Early Stage Dementia**:

- Person can process and benefit from factual information
- Orientation cues support independence
- Reality checks reduce confusion

**Mild Cognitive Impairment**:

- Memory supports are helpful and welcomed
- Environmental modifications support function

#### When Reality Orientation is Not Appropriate

**Moderate to Severe Dementia**:

- Repeated corrections cause distress
- Person cannot retain orientation information
- Forcing reality orientation leads to:
  - Frustration and anger
  - Feelings of failure
  - Repeated grief (e.g., learning again that spouse died)
  - Catastrophic reactions

**In these cases, validation therapy is more appropriate**.

#### Gentle Reality Orientation

A modified approach:

- Provide orientation **without correcting or arguing**
- Offer information **naturally in conversation**
- Don't **quiz or test** ("What day is it?")
- Accept when person cannot orient
- Shift to validation if distress occurs

**Example**:

- **Person**: "What day is it?"
- **Caregiver**: "Today is Wednesday. We have your doctor's appointment this afternoon."
- (If person doesn't retain this, repeat calmly later without frustration)

#### Combining Approaches

Many caregivers use a combination:

- **Use RO** when the person can benefit and it doesn't cause distress
- **Switch to validation** when reality orientation causes agitation
- **Focus on feelings** rather than facts as dementia progresses

**Flexible, person-centered care is most effective.**

## Sensory-Based Therapies

### Sensory Stimulation

Sensory stimulation therapy uses sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell to engage people with dementia and improve quality of life.

#### Multisensory Environments (Snoezelen)

Snoezelen rooms are specially designed spaces with controlled sensory input:

**Components**:

- **Visual**: Fiber optic lights, bubble tubes, projections, mirrors
- **Auditory**: Calming music, nature sounds
- **Tactile**: Textured materials, vibrating cushions, soft furnishings
- **Olfactory**: Essential oil diffusers with calming scents
- **Vestibular**: Gentle rocking chairs, swings

**Purpose**:

- Provide **calming, pleasurable sensory experiences**
- Reduce **agitation and anxiety**
- Offer **non-demanding leisure activity**
- Support **communication** through sensory responses

**Evidence**: Studies show Snoezelen can reduce agitation and improve mood, particularly in moderate to severe dementia.

#### Sensory Activities at Home

You don't need a specialized room to provide sensory stimulation.

**Visual Stimulation**:

- Nature watching (bird feeders outside window)
- Aquariums (real or digital)
- Photo slideshows of family and familiar places
- Colorful art, flowers, seasonal decorations
- Light therapy (bright light in morning for circadian rhythm)

**Auditory Stimulation**:

- Personalized music playlists
- Nature sounds (ocean waves, rain, birds)
- Recordings of grandchildren's voices
- Audiobooks, old radio shows

**Tactile Stimulation**:

- **Fidget blankets**: Quilts with various textures, buttons, zippers, pockets
- **Twiddle muffs**: Hand warmers with attached tactile objects
- **Sensory boxes**: Containers with items to touch (smooth stones, soft fabric, wooden objects)
- **Hand massage**: Using lotion, gentle pressure
- **Pet therapy** (soft fur to stroke)

**Olfactory Stimulation**:

- **Familiar scents**: Coffee brewing, bread baking, flowers
- **Aromatherapy**: Lavender (calming), citrus (energizing), peppermint (alertness)
- **Caution**: Some scents may trigger negative memories; observe reactions

**Gustatory Stimulation**:

- Favorite foods and treats
- Taste tests (sweet, salty, sour, bitter)
- Cultural or traditional foods
- Texture variety (crunchy, smooth, chewy)

#### Creating Sensory Boxes

**Memory Sensory Box** (personalized):

- Items related to person's interests, occupation, hobbies
- Textured items from their past
- Photos and small meaningful objects

**General Sensory Box Ideas**:

- **Garden box**: Artificial flowers, gardening gloves, seed packets, smooth stones
- **Kitchen box**: Wooden spoon, pot holder, recipe cards, measuring cups
- **Baby box**: Soft baby blanket, baby powder scent, baby doll, rattle
- **Work box**: Tools, office supplies, or items related to former occupation

#### Sensory Biographies

Document the person's sensory preferences:

- Favorite smells, sounds, tastes, textures
- Sensory aversions (loud noises, certain textures)
- Cultural sensory experiences
- Sensory memories from youth

### Pet Therapy (Animal-Assisted Therapy)

Pet therapy uses interactions with animals to provide comfort, companionship, and therapeutic benefits for people with dementia.

#### Benefits of Pet Therapy

**Emotional Benefits**:

- **Reduces loneliness** and isolation
- **Decreases anxiety** and agitation
- **Improves mood** and reduces depression
- **Provides comfort** and unconditional acceptance
- **Increases feelings of being needed** (caring for pet)

**Physical Benefits**:

- **Increases activity** (walking dog, playing with pet)
- **Lowers blood pressure** and heart rate
- **Promotes movement** and exercise
- **Stimulates touch** (petting, grooming)

**Social Benefits**:

#### Types of Pet Therapy

**1. Visiting Therapy Animals**

Trained therapy dogs (or cats, rabbits) and handlers visit:

- Memory care units
- Day programs
- Hospitals
- Private homes

**Certification**: Look for certified therapy animals (AKC Therapy Dog, Pet Partners)

**2. Resident Animals**

Facility pets that live in care settings:

- Cats, dogs, birds, fish, rabbits
- Provide ongoing companionship
- Residents can help with care (brushing, feeding)

**3. Personal Pets**

Keeping the family pet at home:

- Continuity and familiarity
- Ongoing companionship
- Must consider safety and care responsibilities

#### Considerations for Personal Pets

**Benefits of Keeping Pets**:

- Familiar companion provides comfort
- Maintains routine and purpose
- Supports sense of normalcy

**Challenges**:

- Person may forget to feed or care for pet
- May become confused about pet's identity
- Safety concerns (tripping over pet, inappropriate feeding)

**Solutions**:

- **Caregiver assumes pet care** while person participates when able
- **Simplify care tasks**: Person can brush pet while caregiver handles feeding, vet visits
- **Use reminders**: Notes about pet care
- **Ensure pet is calm and well-trained**: Avoid jumping, nipping

#### When to Consider Rehoming a Pet

Difficult decision, but necessary if:

- Person becomes aggressive toward pet
- Pet is causing falls or safety issues
- Caregiver cannot manage both person's care and pet's needs
- Person no longer recognizes or connects with pet

**Alternatives**:

- Rehome with family member (so pet can visit)
- Visiting therapy animals instead
- Robotic pets (see below)

#### Robotic Pets

Realistic robotic animals provide some benefits without care needs:

**Examples**:

- **Robotic cats and dogs**: Life-like appearance, purring, barking, head movements, sensors respond to petting
- **PARO** (robotic seal): Therapeutic robot used in dementia care worldwide

**Benefits**:

- No feeding, walking, or vet care needed
- Cannot scratch, bite, or cause allergies
- Always available
- Can be used by those who cannot care for live animals

**Effectiveness**: Research shows robotic pets can reduce agitation and improve engagement, though live animals may be more effective for some people.

#### Safety Considerations

- **Allergies**: Confirm no allergies to animal
- **Fear**: Some people are frightened by dogs or other animals
- **Hygiene**: Animals must be clean and healthy
- **Behavior**: Therapy animals should be calm, gentle, well-trained
- **Supervision**: Monitor interactions, especially in advanced dementia

### Aromatherapy

Aromatherapy uses essential oils and scents to promote relaxation, reduce agitation, and improve well-being in people with dementia.

#### How Aromatherapy Works

- **Olfactory system**: Smell is directly connected to limbic system (emotions, memory)
- **Scents can trigger memories**: Familiar smells evoke emotional responses
- **Physiological effects**: Some essential oils have calming or stimulating properties

#### Common Essential Oils for Dementia Care

**Calming/Relaxing**:

- **Lavender**: Most researched; reduces agitation, anxiety, improves sleep
- **Chamomile**: Calming, soothing
- **Ylang ylang**: Reduces anxiety, promotes relaxation
- **Bergamot**: Uplifting yet calming

**Stimulating/Alertness**:

- **Rosemary**: May support memory and alertness
- **Peppermint**: Energizing, improves focus
- **Lemon**: Uplifting, refreshing
- **Eucalyptus**: Invigorating, clears mind

**Sleep Support**:

- **Lavender**: Promotes relaxation and sleep
- **Cedarwood**: Grounding, sedating
- **Vetiver**: Calming, sleep-inducing

#### Methods of Use

**1. Diffusion**

- **Electric diffusers**: Disperse essential oil into air
- **Passive diffusion**: Add drops to cotton ball or tissue

**2. Topical Application**

- **Always dilute**: Mix essential oil with carrier oil (coconut, almond, jojoba)
- **Common ratio**: 2-3 drops essential oil per teaspoon carrier oil
- **Application sites**: Wrists, temples, back of neck, feet
- **Hand massage**: Massage diluted oil into hands

**3. Bath**

- Add a few drops to bathwater (diluted in carrier oil first)
- Aromatherapy bath salts

**4. Inhalation**

- Add drops to tissue and have person breathe in
- Aromatherapy necklaces or bracelets

#### Safety Guidelines

**Precautions**:

- **Never ingest** essential oils
- **Always dilute** for topical use
- **Patch test**: Test on small skin area first
- **Avoid sensitive areas**: Eyes, mucous membranes, broken skin
- **Medical conditions**: Check with doctor if person has asthma, allergies, or other conditions
- **Quality**: Use therapeutic-grade essential oils from reputable sources

**Potential Issues**:

- **Allergic reactions**: Skin irritation, respiratory problems
- **Medication interactions**: Some oils may interact with medications
- **Overpowering scents**: Too strong can cause headaches or nausea
- **Individual dislikes**: Person may not like certain scents

**Watch for reactions**: If person shows signs of distress, discontinue use.

#### Evidence Base

Research on aromatherapy for dementia:

- **Lavender**: Multiple studies show reduction in agitation
- **Melissa (lemon balm)**: Some evidence for calming effects
- **Mixed results**: Not all studies show benefits; effects vary by individual
- **Placebo effects**: Pleasant scents may improve mood regardless of specific therapeutic properties

**Best practice**: Use aromatherapy as part of a comprehensive approach, not as sole intervention.

#### Practical Tips

- **Start with familiar scents**: Scents from person's past (baking, flowers)
- **Use strategically**: Calming scents during bath time, evening; stimulating scents in morning
- **Observe responses**: Note which scents person prefers and which cause positive effects
- **Less is more**: Light scent is better than overpowering
- **Create positive associations**: Pair scents with pleasant activities

## Key Takeaways

1. **Non-pharmacological interventions** are essential components of dementia care, often as effective as medications for quality of life and behavioral symptoms.

2. **Professional therapies** (cognitive stimulation, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy) should be considered at various stages of dementia to maintain function and address specific challenges.

3. **Music therapy** is particularly powerful for dementia due to preserved musical memory and emotional connections. Creating personalized playlists can be a simple, effective intervention families can implement at home.

4. **Art therapy** provides nonverbal expression and success-oriented activities that maintain dignity and provide meaningful engagement.

5. **Reminiscence therapy** leverages preserved remote memory to support identity, mood, and communication. Creating memory boxes and life story books benefits both the person and family members.

6. **Validation therapy** meets the person in their reality rather than forcing them into ours, reducing distress and improving relationships. Key principle: validate feelings, not facts.

7. **Reality orientation** is most appropriate in early-stage dementia; as dementia progresses, validation therapy becomes more effective and person-centered.

8. **Sensory stimulation** engages multiple senses to provide pleasure, reduce agitation, and offer non-demanding activities appropriate across all stages.

9. **Pet therapy** provides emotional comfort, social connection, and purpose. Robotic pets can be effective alternatives when live animals are not feasible.

10. **Aromatherapy and massage** offer simple, low-cost interventions that caregivers can learn and implement at home to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.

11. **Individualization is critical**: Not every intervention works for every person. Observe responses, respect preferences, and adapt approaches based on the individual's background, interests, and stage of dementia.

12. **Combination approaches work best**: Use multiple complementary interventions rather than relying on a single therapy. A comprehensive care plan might include exercise, music, reminiscence, and hand massage.

13. **Process over product**: In therapeutic activities, focus on engagement and enjoyment rather than the end result or "doing it right."

14. **Training and support**: Caregivers benefit from learning therapeutic techniques from professionals, but many interventions can be simplified for home use.

15. **Evidence-based but person-centered**: While research guides us toward effective interventions, individual response matters most. If it brings joy and comfort without causing harm, it's valuable.
