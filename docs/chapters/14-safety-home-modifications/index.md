# Chapter 14: Safety and Home Modifications

## Introduction

Creating a safe home environment is one of the most important responsibilities in dementia care. As cognitive abilities decline, the person with dementia becomes more vulnerable to accidents, injuries, and potentially dangerous situations. What was once a familiar, comfortable home can become filled with hazards.

This chapter provides comprehensive guidance on assessing safety risks and implementing practical modifications that reduce dangers while preserving independence and dignity. You'll learn how to prevent falls, manage wandering, ensure medication safety, and prepare for emergencies—all while creating an environment that feels like home, not an institution.

**The Balance**: Safety modifications must balance risk reduction with quality of life. The goal isn't to eliminate all risk (impossible) but to create reasonable safety while allowing the person to live as normally as possible.

## The Importance of Home Safety in Dementia Care

**Why Safety Matters**:

- **Injury prevention**: People with dementia are at higher risk for falls, burns, poisoning, and other accidents
- **Supports independence**: A safe environment allows the person to move freely without constant supervision
- **Reduces caregiver stress**: Knowing the home is safe provides peace of mind
- **Prevents hospitalization**: Many accidents are preventable with proper modifications
- **Maintains dignity**: Safety measures allow the person to remain at home longer
- **Protects from wandering risks**: Secure environment prevents dangerous exits

**Risk Factors Increase Over Time**:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Poor judgment, forgetting safety rules, not recognizing hazards
- **Physical changes**: Balance problems, slower reflexes, vision changes, gait instability
- **Behavioral changes**: Wandering, agitation, impulsivity
- **Medication effects**: Some medications increase fall risk

## 1. Fall Prevention

Falls are the leading cause of injury among older adults with dementia. People with dementia are 2-3 times more likely to fall than those without cognitive impairment.

### Why Falls Occur in Dementia

**Cognitive Factors**:
- Poor judgment about abilities
- Forgetting to use assistive devices
- Disorientation
- Impaired spatial awareness
- Not recognizing hazards

**Physical Factors**:
- Balance and gait problems
- Muscle weakness
- Vision changes
- Slower reflexes
- Medication side effects (sedation, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension)

**Environmental Factors**:
- Clutter and obstacles
- Poor lighting
- Slippery floors
- Loose rugs
- Uneven surfaces
- Lack of handrails

### Comprehensive Fall Prevention Strategies

### What to Do If a Fall Occurs

**Immediate Response**:
1. Stay calm
2. Ask if they're hurt before moving them
3. Check for bleeding, pain, deformity
4. If injured, call 911
5. If not injured, help them up slowly (see below)
6. Monitor for 24-48 hours for delayed symptoms

**Helping Someone Up After a Fall**:
1. Bring a sturdy chair to them
2. Have them roll onto their side
3. Help them to hands and knees
4. Place chair in front of them
5. Have them use chair to pull up to kneeling
6. Put stronger leg forward
7. Help them stand using chair for support
8. Sit them in chair to rest and assess

**After a Fall**:
- Document what happened
- Try to determine cause
- Make environmental changes to prevent recurrence
- Inform doctor (fall may indicate infection, medication issue, or stroke)
- Reassess safety throughout home

### Fall Risk Assessment

Regularly assess fall risk by considering:
- History of falls
- Gait and balance problems
- Medications that increase fall risk
- Vision problems
- Orthostatic hypotension (dizziness when standing)
- Environmental hazards

- When abilities decline noticeably
- When new behaviors emerge (wandering, agitation)
- After hospitalization
- When moving to new residence

## 3. Grab Bars

Grab bars provide crucial support and stability, especially in bathrooms where most falls occur. Properly installed grab bars can prevent falls and provide confidence.

### Types of Grab Bars

**Permanent Grab Bars**:
- Screwed into wall studs or blocking
- Most secure option
- Various lengths (12" to 48")
- Straight, angled, or L-shaped
- Weight capacity typically 250-500 lbs

**Temporary/Suction Grab Bars**:
- Attach with suction cups
- Portable (good for travel)
- NOT recommended for primary support (can fail)
- Only suitable for light support
- Must be on smooth, non-porous surface

**Floor-to-Ceiling Grab Bars**:
- Tension-mounted between floor and ceiling
- No drilling required (good for rentals)
- Less secure than wall-mounted
- Can work if ceiling is sturdy

**Tub and Toilet Rails**:
- Clamp onto edge of tub or toilet
- Tool-free installation
- Provides support for specific transfers
- Weight capacity usually 250-300 lbs

### Where to Install Grab Bars

**Bathtub/Shower**:
- **Vertical bar on wall at entry**: For balance when stepping in
- **Horizontal bar on back wall**: 33-36" from floor, for support while standing
- **Horizontal bar on side wall**: For sitting/standing from shower chair
- **Angled bar**: 45° angle from low to high, helps with sitting and standing

**Toilet**:
- **One bar on each side**: 33-36" from floor, 1.5 feet long minimum
- **Fold-down bar**: If space is limited
- **Toilet safety frame**: Standalone option that clamps to toilet

**Bedroom**:
- Near bed if person has difficulty with transfers
- Consider bed rail instead

**Hallways**:
- Along long hallways if balance is poor
- Continuous handrail from bedroom to bathroom

**Stairs** (see Handrails section):
- Both sides of stairs
- Extends beyond top and bottom steps

### Proper Installation

**Critical Installation Guidelines**:
- **MUST be installed into wall studs** (studs are typically 16" apart)
- If stud isn't in right location, install blocking between studs
- Never install into drywall alone (will pull out under weight)
- Use screws, not drywall anchors (anchors can fail)
- Install at proper height (typically 33-36" from floor)
- Ensure grab bar is level
- Test installation by pulling with full body weight

**Installation Steps**:
1. Locate wall studs using stud finder
2. Mark installation height (33-36" from floor)
3. Hold bar in place and mark screw holes
4. Drill pilot holes into studs
5. Attach bar with screws provided (usually 2-3 inches long)
6. Tighten securely
7. Test by pulling hard

**When Studs Aren't Available**:
- Install backing board (plywood) between studs during renovation
- Use blocking between studs
- Consider floor-to-ceiling pole
- Hire professional installer
- Use clamp-on rails for toilet/tub

**Professional Installation**:
Recommended if:
- You're not confident in DIY installation
- Wall construction is unusual
- Structural concerns exist
- Multiple bars needed throughout home
- Occupational therapist recommends specific placement

### Choosing the Right Grab Bars

**Considerations**:
- **Diameter**: 1.25" to 1.5" diameter is easiest to grip
- **Texture**: Textured or ridged for better grip, especially when wet
- **Color**: Contrasting color from wall helps visibility
- **Material**: Stainless steel is most durable and rust-resistant
- **Length**: Based on available space and user needs
- **Weight capacity**: Check rating (usually 250-500 lbs)

**Avoid**:
- Towel bars (not designed for weight-bearing, will pull out)
- Soap dishes or shelves (not secure)
- Suction bars as primary support (can fail)

### Using Grab Bars Safely

**Proper Use**:
- Grasp with full hand, not just fingers
- Pull toward your center of gravity
- Don't lean all weight on bar too far from wall
- Use both hands when possible
- Don't use to pull from floor (too much force, can pull out)

**Teaching the Person**:
- Show them where grab bars are located
- Practice using them when they're calm and stable
- Provide verbal cues: "Hold the bar"
- Ensure adequate lighting so they can see bars
- Consider contrasting color for better visibility

## 4. Non-Slip Flooring

Slippery floors are a major fall hazard. The right flooring and treatments significantly reduce fall risk.

### Best Flooring Options for Dementia Care

**Good Flooring Choices**:

**Carpet with Low Pile**:
- Provides cushioning in falls
- Good traction
- Warmer underfoot
- Should be tightly woven and secured
- ❌ Avoid: High pile, shag, or loop carpets (tripping hazard, walker wheels catch)

**Vinyl or Linoleum** (matte finish):
- Easy to clean
- Water-resistant
- Non-slip when dry
- Good for kitchen and bathroom
- ❌ Avoid: Glossy finishes (slippery)

**Cork**:
- Naturally slip-resistant
- Cushioned surface
- Warm underfoot
- Moisture-resistant when sealed

**Rubber Flooring**:
- Excellent slip-resistance
- Cushioned
- Durable
- Good for bathrooms
- Can look institutional

**Wood (with proper treatment)**:
- Use matte finish, not glossy
- Apply non-slip treatment
- Keep clean (dust makes it slippery)
- ❌ Can be slippery when wet

**Flooring to Avoid**:
- **Tile** (very slippery when wet, cold, hard if they fall)
- **High-gloss finishes** (any material)
- **Marble or polished stone** (extremely slippery)
- **Loose rugs** (tripping hazard)
- **Transitions between floor types** (minimize or mark clearly)

### Making Existing Floors Safer

**Remove or Secure Rugs**:
- Remove all throw rugs if possible
- If keeping rugs: Use non-slip rug pads underneath (rug pads rated for floor type)
- Tape down edges with double-sided carpet tape
- Use rugs with rubber backing
- Still, removing is safest

**Apply Non-Slip Treatments**:

**For Hard Floors**:
- Non-slip floor coatings (professionally applied)
- Adhesive non-slip strips (stairs, bathroom)
- Anti-slip tape (high-traffic areas)
- Non-slip floor wax (matte finish)

**For Tile**:
- Non-slip treatment products (increase surface friction)
- Non-slip mats (bathroom, kitchen sink)
- Consider replacing if very slippery

**For Wood**:
- Matte finish polyurethane (not glossy)
- Non-slip wax
- Keep clean and dust-free

### Bathroom Floor Safety

**Critical Area** (most falls happen here):
- Install non-slip mats inside tub/shower
- Non-slip mat on bathroom floor (secured, no curled edges)
- Keep floor dry at all times
- Wipe up water immediately
- Consider textured vinyl or rubber flooring
- Use bath rugs with rubber backing (or remove entirely)

### Maintenance for Slip Resistance

**Regular Cleaning**:
- Dust and debris make floors slippery
- Clean up spills immediately
- Use appropriate cleaners (some leave slippery residue)
- Avoid wax buildup
- Dry floors thoroughly after mopping

**Periodic Checks**:
- Check rug pads for wear
- Replace worn non-slip mats
- Reapply non-slip treatments as needed
- Check for damage to flooring
- Ensure transitions are secure

### Visual Considerations

**Avoid Patterns That Confuse**:
- People with dementia may misinterpret patterns
- Dark patterns may look like holes
- High-contrast patterns may appear as steps
- Shiny floors may look wet
- Choose solid, matte colors
- Use contrasting colors only at true transitions (doorways, step edges)

## 5. Adequate Lighting

Good lighting is essential for safety, reduces confusion, and helps with visual changes common in aging and dementia. Poor lighting increases fall risk and can increase agitation (especially in evening).

### Why Lighting Matters in Dementia

**Vision Changes**:
- Reduced ability to see in low light
- Difficulty adjusting to light changes
- Increased sensitivity to glare
- Reduced depth perception
- Cataracts common (creates cloudy vision, glare sensitivity)

**Safety**:
- Prevents falls by making obstacles visible
- Helps with depth perception (stairs, curbs)
- Reduces confusion about environment
- Makes grab bars and safety features visible

**Behavioral Benefits**:
- Good lighting reduces sundowning
- Eliminates frightening shadows
- Reduces confusion and agitation
- Helps with orientation

### Principles of Good Lighting

**Brightness**:
- Use higher wattage than typical for older adults
- All areas should be well-lit, no dim corners
- Light should be bright enough to read comfortably
- But avoid overly bright lights that create glare

**Uniformity**:
- Consistent light levels throughout home
- Avoid sudden changes from bright to dark
- Transitions (doorways, hallways) especially important
- No dark corners or shadows

**Eliminate Glare**:
- Use matte or frosted bulbs, not clear
- Avoid light shining directly in eyes
- Cover shiny surfaces (glass tables)
- Use lampshades to diffuse light
- Avoid reflective floors

**Natural Light**:
- Open curtains during day
- Natural light helps with circadian rhythm
- But control to avoid glare
- Use sheer curtains to diffuse bright sunlight

### Lighting by Room

**Hallways**:
- Bright overhead lighting
- Motion-sensor lights for nighttime
- Light switches at both ends
- No shadows or dark spots
- Night lights every 10-15 feet

**Stairways**:

- Highly decorative fixtures that don't provide good light
- Lamps with hard-to-operate switches
- Flickering fluorescent lights (can increase agitation)

## 6. Door Locks

Door locks serve two important purposes: security from outside intruders and prevention of wandering. Balancing these needs requires thoughtful modifications.

### Wandering: Understanding the Risk

**Why People with Dementia Wander**:
- Searching for something (home, person, familiar place)
- Following old routine (going to work)
- Boredom or restlessness
- Disorientation
- Need for purpose or activity
- Sensory seeking (wanting to be outside)

**Dangers of Wandering**:
- Getting lost and unable to find way back
- Exposure to weather (hypothermia, heat stroke)
- Traffic accidents
- Falls in unfamiliar areas
- Dehydration
- Drowning (attraction to water)
- Victimization

**Statistics**:
- 60% of people with dementia will wander
- If not found within 24 hours, risk of serious injury or death increases dramatically
- Wandering is a leading cause of death in dementia

### Door Lock Modifications

- Keyed window locks
- Window alarms
- Security bars (must have quick-release for fire safety)
- Keep upper-floor windows locked

**Ground Floor Considerations**:
- Especially important for first-floor and basement windows
- Person may try to exit through window if door is secured
- Consider planting thorny bushes under windows (natural deterrent)

### Balancing Safety and Fire Code

**Critical Considerations**:
- Modifications MUST allow emergency egress
- Caregiver must be able to quickly evacuate person in fire
- Some lock types are illegal (check local fire codes)
- Emergency responders must be able to access home

**Recommendations**:
- Use locks that are quick-release for caregiver
- Never use locks that trap person without caregiver intervention
- Keep key immediately accessible (not hidden away)
- Practice emergency evacuation
- Notify fire department about situation (many have registry programs)

### Beyond Locks: Reducing Wandering

**Environmental Strategies**:
- Place "STOP" sign on door
- Paint door same color as wall (camouflage)

### When Medical Alert Systems Help

**Scenarios**:
- Person lives alone (even part-time)
- Caregiver can't be within hearing distance
- Person at high risk of falls
- Person has medical conditions requiring quick response
- Caregiver needs to step away
- Nighttime (caregiver is asleep)
- Caregiver has health issues and may need help

**Limitations**:
- Person must remember to wear device
- Person must remember to press button
- Person must be able to press button
- In later stages, person may not understand how to use
- Better for early to middle stage

### Choosing a System

**Features to Consider**:

- Generally yes, worth the cost

## Creating a Safe Environment While Maintaining Dignity

**The Balance**:
Safety modifications should not make the home feel institutional or stripped of personality. The goal is to maintain familiar, comfortable surroundings while reducing risks.

### Principles of Dignified Safety

**Preserve Autonomy**:
- Allow the person to do what they safely can
- Don't remove all risks (some risk is part of life)
- Make gradual changes as abilities decline
- Include person in decisions when possible

**Maintain Familiarity**:
- Keep familiar furniture and belongings
- Don't drastically redecorate
- Changes should be subtle
- Maintain routines

**Aesthetic Considerations**:
- Grab bars in colors that match bathroom
- Attractive lighting (not institutional)
- Keep decor pleasant
- Hide adaptations when possible (door locks out of sight)

**Person-Centered Approach**:
- Modifications based on individual needs
- Consider their history, preferences, and personality
- What works for one person may not work for another
- Be flexible and creative

### Progressive Changes

**Early Stage**:
- Subtle modifications
- Person may participate in safety planning
- Maintain independence
- Focus on fall prevention

**Middle Stage**:
- More extensive modifications
- Increased supervision
- Balance safety with freedom
- May need to remove access to kitchen, garage, etc.

**Late Stage**:
- Maximum safety measures
- Constant supervision or secure environment
- Comfort is priority
- May need specialized care setting
