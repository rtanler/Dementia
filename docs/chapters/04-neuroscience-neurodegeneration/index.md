# The Neuroscience of Neurodegeneration

## Summary

This chapter examines the pathological mechanisms underlying different forms of dementia at the cellular and molecular level. You will learn about amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease), as well as specific proteins involved in neurodegeneration including tau protein, beta-amyloid, and alpha-synuclein. The chapter also covers rare neurodegenerative conditions like Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Understanding these biological processes helps explain why dementia develops and provides context for current and future treatment strategies.

## Concepts Covered
