# Diagnosis and Assessment

## Summary

This comprehensive chapter covers the diagnostic process for dementia, including cognitive assessments, brain imaging, laboratory tests, and differential diagnosis. You will learn about cognitive screening tools like the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Clock Drawing Test. The chapter explains various brain imaging techniques (MRI, CT, PET, and SPECT scans), blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, genetic testing, and biomarkers. You will also understand how doctors distinguish dementia from other conditions like delirium and depression through differential diagnosis, and how functional assessments evaluate a person's ability to perform daily activities. This knowledge helps families understand what to expect during medical evaluations and how diagnostic information guides treatment planning.
