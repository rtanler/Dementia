# Risk Factors and Prevention Strategies

## Summary

This chapter examines the risk factors for dementia and evidence-based strategies that may help reduce risk or delay onset. You will learn about non-modifiable risk factors including age-related risk, genetic factors (particularly the APOE gene), and family history. More importantly, the chapter covers modifiable risk factors related to cardiovascular health (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol) and protective lifestyle factors including physical exercise, mental stimulation, and social engagement. You will also learn about the Mediterranean diet, brain-healthy lifestyle practices, and the importance of smoking cessation. While no prevention strategy can guarantee protection from dementia, understanding these factors empowers individuals to make lifestyle choices that support long-term brain health.
