# Understanding Different Types of Dementia

## Summary

This chapter introduces the major types of dementia and their distinguishing characteristics. You will learn about Alzheimer's disease (the most common form), vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and mixed dementia. The chapter also covers less common forms including cerebrovascular disease, mini-strokes, and rare dementia types such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Understanding these different types will help you recognize that dementia is not a single disease but rather a collection of conditions with varying causes and presentations.

## Why Are There Different Types of Dementia?

In Chapter 1, we learned that dementia is a syndrome—a collection of symptoms—rather than a single disease. Just as "fever" can be caused by many different illnesses, "dementia" can result from many different brain conditions. Each type of dementia has distinct causes, affects different brain regions, progresses at different rates, and produces characteristic patterns of symptoms.

Understanding the different types of dementia is important for several reasons:

- **Diagnosis** - Different types require different diagnostic approaches
- **Treatment** - Some treatments work better for specific types
- **Prognosis** - Different types progress at different rates
- **Care planning** - Each type presents unique challenges for caregivers
- **Research** - Understanding causes helps develop targeted treatments

While the symptoms of different dementia types overlap considerably, each has distinguishing features that help doctors make an accurate diagnosis. In this chapter, we'll explore each major type, learning what causes it, which brain regions it affects, and what makes it unique.

## How Common Are Different Types of Dementia?

Before diving into specifics, it's helpful to understand how common each type is. **Alzheimer's disease** is by far the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of all cases. However, many people have more than one type simultaneously, which we call mixed dementia.

Here's the approximate breakdown of dementia cases:

- **Alzheimer's disease** - 60-80% of cases
- **Vascular dementia** - 10-20% of cases (second most common)
- **Lewy body dementia** - 5-10% of cases
- **Frontotemporal dementia** - 5-10% of cases (more common in people under 65)
- **Mixed dementia** - 10-20% of cases (often Alzheimer's plus vascular)
- **Other rare types** - Less than 5% combined

These percentages overlap because many people have mixed dementia—two or more types occurring together. As diagnostic techniques improve, we're discovering that mixed dementia is more common than previously thought.

## Alzheimer's Disease: The Most Common Type

**Alzheimer's disease** is not just the most common type of dementia—it's also the most well-known and heavily researched. Named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906, this disease involves specific changes in brain tissue that disrupt normal brain function.

### What Causes Alzheimer's Disease?

Alzheimer's disease is caused by abnormal buildups of proteins in and around brain cells. Two types of protein deposits characterize Alzheimer's:

- **Amyloid plaques** - Sticky clumps of beta-amyloid protein that build up between neurons
- **Neurofibrillary tangles** - Twisted fibers of tau protein that form inside dying cells

These protein deposits damage and kill neurons, particularly in the hippocampus (memory center) and cerebral cortex (thinking and planning center). As neurons die, the brain shrinks, and cognitive abilities decline. The disease typically begins decades before symptoms appear, with proteins slowly accumulating while the brain can still compensate.

### Brain Regions Affected

Alzheimer's disease typically affects the brain in a predictable pattern:

1. **Hippocampus** (first and most severely affected)
   - Results in difficulty forming new memories
   - Explains why recent memories are lost before old ones

2. **Temporal lobes**
   - Causes problems with language and word-finding
   - Affects ability to recognize familiar faces

3. **Parietal lobes**
   - Leads to spatial disorientation
   - Makes tasks like dressing or navigation difficult

4. **Frontal lobes** (affected in later stages)
   - Impacts judgment and decision-making
   - Changes personality and behavior

### Characteristic Symptoms

The hallmark symptom of Alzheimer's disease is progressive memory loss, especially for recent events. Other common symptoms include:

- Difficulty remembering recent conversations or events
- Problems with language (finding words, following conversations)
- Disorientation to time and place
- Poor judgment and decision-making
- Withdrawal from social activities
- Changes in mood and personality
- Difficulty with familiar tasks
- Misplacing items in unusual places

!!! note "Early-Onset vs. Late-Onset Alzheimer's"
    Most people develop Alzheimer's after age 65 (late-onset). However, about 5-10% of cases occur before age 65 (early-onset). Early-onset Alzheimer's often progresses more quickly and is more likely to have a genetic component.

## Vascular Dementia: When Blood Flow Is Disrupted

**Vascular dementia** is the second most common type of dementia, caused by reduced blood flow to the brain. Unlike Alzheimer's, which involves protein deposits, vascular dementia results from damage to blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen and nutrients.

### What Causes Vascular Dementia?

Vascular dementia occurs when brain cells are damaged due to inadequate blood supply. This can happen in two main ways:

**Cerebrovascular disease** refers to conditions affecting blood vessels in the brain, including:

- **Stroke** - A single large stroke can cause sudden, significant cognitive decline
- **Mini-strokes (TIAs)** - Multiple small strokes that each cause minor damage, but accumulate over time
- **Small vessel disease** - Damage to tiny blood vessels deep in the brain

Risk factors for vascular dementia are the same as those for heart disease and stroke:

- High blood pressure (hypertension)
- High cholesterol
- Diabetes
- Smoking
- Obesity
- Atrial fibrillation
- History of heart disease

### Mini-Strokes and Step-Wise Decline

One distinctive feature of vascular dementia is its often "stepwise" progression. Unlike Alzheimer's, which gradually worsens over time, vascular dementia may suddenly worsen following a stroke or **mini-stroke** (transient ischemic attack), then stabilize for a period before the next event causes another decline.

Mini-strokes are temporary blockages of blood flow that don't cause permanent symptoms on their own but can accumulate to cause dementia. Many people don't even realize they've had mini-strokes until brain imaging reveals multiple small areas of damage.

### Brain Regions Affected

The symptoms of vascular dementia depend on which parts of the brain are affected by reduced blood flow. Common patterns include:

- **Subcortical vascular dementia** - Affects deep brain structures, causing slowed thinking and movement problems
- **Cortical vascular dementia** - Affects outer brain layers, causing problems similar to Alzheimer's
- **Mixed patterns** - Damage in multiple areas

### Characteristic Symptoms

Vascular dementia symptoms vary more than Alzheimer's symptoms because they depend on where blood vessel damage occurs. Common features include:

- Slowed thinking and processing speed
- Difficulty with planning and organization
- Problems with attention and concentration
- Mood changes, especially depression
- Physical symptoms (weakness, paralysis, vision changes) if caused by stroke
- Memory problems (but often less severe than in Alzheimer's)
- Changes in walking (shuffling, small steps)

Unlike Alzheimer's, memory may be relatively preserved in early vascular dementia, while executive functions (planning, organizing, decision-making) are more impaired.

!!! tip "Prevention Matters"
    Vascular dementia is the most preventable type of dementia. Controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, along with not smoking and exercising regularly, can significantly reduce risk.

## Lewy Body Dementia: More Than Memory Problems

**Lewy body dementia** (LBD) is the third most common type of dementia, though it's often misdiagnosed because its symptoms overlap with both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It's caused by abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein, which form structures called Lewy bodies in the brain.

### What Causes Lewy Body Dementia?

Lewy bodies are abnormal clumps of the protein alpha-synuclein that build up inside neurons. These deposits interfere with chemical messengers in the brain, particularly dopamine (important for movement) and acetylcholine (important for thinking and memory).

Scientists don't fully understand why Lewy bodies form, but they appear in specific brain regions:

- **Cortex** - Causing cognitive problems
- **Brainstem** - Causing movement problems
- **Substantia nigra** - Affecting dopamine production (same area affected in Parkinson's disease)

### Relationship to Parkinson's Disease Dementia

**Lewy body dementia** and **Parkinson's disease dementia** are closely related conditions, both involving Lewy body deposits. The main difference is timing:

- **Lewy body dementia** - Cognitive symptoms appear first or within a year of movement problems
- **Parkinson's disease dementia** - Movement problems (tremor, rigidity, slow movement) appear years before cognitive decline

Both are sometimes grouped together as "Lewy body dementias" because the underlying brain changes are similar.

### Characteristic Symptoms

Lewy body dementia has three hallmark features that distinguish it from other types:

1. **Fluctuating cognition**
   - Alertness and attention vary dramatically day-to-day or even hour-to-hour
   - A person may be lucid and coherent one moment, confused the next
   - This fluctuation is unique to LBD

2. **Visual hallucinations**
   - Seeing things that aren't there, typically detailed and realistic
   - Often seeing people or animals
   - Unlike delusions, the person may recognize these aren't real

3. **Movement problems (Parkinsonism)**
   - Shuffling walk
   - Muscle stiffness
   - Tremor (though less common than in Parkinson's disease)
   - Frequent falls

Additional symptoms common in Lewy body dementia include:

- REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams)
- Severe sensitivity to antipsychotic medications
- Problems with automatic functions (blood pressure, temperature, digestion)
- Depression and anxiety
- Spatial disorientation
- Problems with executive functions

!!! warning "Medication Sensitivity"
    People with Lewy body dementia can have severe, sometimes life-threatening reactions to typical antipsychotic medications. It's crucial that doctors know about an LBD diagnosis before prescribing medications.

## Frontotemporal Dementia: Changes in Personality and Behavior

**Frontotemporal dementia** (FTD) is less common than Alzheimer's or vascular dementia, but it's the most common cause of dementia in people under age 60. Unlike other dementias that primarily affect memory, FTD primarily causes changes in personality, behavior, and language.

### What Causes Frontotemporal Dementia?

Frontotemporal dementia is caused by progressive damage to the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain—the areas responsible for personality, behavior, and language. Different abnormal proteins can accumulate in these regions, including tau protein (like in Alzheimer's, but in different forms) and TDP-43 protein.

About 30-40% of FTD cases are inherited, caused by mutations in specific genes. This is a much higher hereditary rate than in Alzheimer's disease.

### Brain Regions Affected

As the name suggests, frontotemporal dementia primarily affects:

- **Frontal lobes** - Control behavior, personality, judgment, planning, and speech production
- **Temporal lobes** - Process language comprehension and semantic memory (knowing what things mean)

The specific symptoms depend on which areas are most affected, leading to different FTD subtypes.

### Types of Frontotemporal Dementia

There are three main variants of FTD, each with distinct symptoms:

**Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD):**
- Most common form
- Dramatic personality and behavior changes
- Loss of empathy and social awareness
- Impulsive, inappropriate behavior
- Apathy or lack of motivation
- Compulsive behaviors
- Changes in eating habits
- Memory relatively preserved in early stages

**Semantic variant FTD (svFTD):**
- Progressive loss of word meaning
- Difficulty naming objects
- Surface reading (can read aloud but doesn't understand)
- Behavior changes may develop later

**Nonfluent/agrammatic variant FTD (nfvFTD):**
- Difficulty producing speech
- Hesitant, effortful speaking
- Grammar errors
- Speech becomes sparse and telegraphic
- Comprehension relatively preserved

### Characteristic Symptoms

The key distinguishing feature of frontotemporal dementia is that personality and behavior changes often occur before significant memory problems. Common symptoms include:

- Loss of social inhibitions (saying/doing inappropriate things)
- Lack of empathy or interest in others
- Compulsive or ritualistic behaviors
- Overeating or craving sweets
- Loss of insight (not recognizing changes)
- Language difficulties (depending on type)
- Executive dysfunction (planning, organizing)
- Emotional flatness or excessive emotions

Unlike Alzheimer's, a person with FTD may score well on memory tests but show dramatic changes in personality that make daily life and relationships extremely difficult.

## Mixed Dementia: When Types Overlap

**Mixed dementia** refers to having two or more types of dementia simultaneously. The most common combination is Alzheimer's disease with vascular dementia, but other combinations occur. Mixed dementia becomes more common with increasing age.

### Why Mixed Dementia Is Important

Mixed dementia is more common than once thought. Studies examining brain tissue after death find that many people diagnosed with "pure" Alzheimer's disease actually had significant vascular damage as well. Understanding mixed dementia is important because:

- It may progress faster than a single type alone
- Treatment needs to address multiple pathologies
- Risk factors (like high blood pressure) may matter more than previously recognized
- It explains why some people don't respond as expected to Alzheimer's treatments

### Common Combinations

The most frequent mixed dementia combinations include:

- **Alzheimer's disease + Vascular dementia** - Most common combination
- **Lewy body dementia + Alzheimer's disease** - Lewy bodies plus amyloid plaques
- **Vascular dementia + Lewy body dementia** - Blood vessel damage plus Lewy bodies

### Diagnosis Challenges

Mixed dementia can be challenging to diagnose during a person's lifetime because:

- Symptoms from different types overlap
- Brain imaging may show changes typical of multiple types
- The dominant type may mask signs of other types
- Definitive diagnosis often requires brain tissue examination after death

Doctors typically diagnose and treat the most prominent dementia type while remaining alert for features suggesting additional pathology.

## Less Common Types of Dementia

While Alzheimer's, vascular, Lewy body, and frontotemporal dementias account for the vast majority of cases, several rare types also exist. Understanding these helps ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate care.

### Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome

**Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome** is a form of dementia caused by severe thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, most commonly due to chronic alcohol misuse. It actually involves two stages:

- **Wernicke encephalopathy** - Acute stage with confusion, vision problems, and loss of muscle coordination
- **Korsakoff syndrome** - Chronic stage with severe memory impairment

Key features include:

- Severe difficulty forming new memories
- Confabulation (making up information to fill memory gaps)
- Often preventable with proper nutrition and thiamine supplementation
- Partial recovery possible if caught early

### Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease

**Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease** (CJD) is a rare, rapidly progressive, and always fatal brain disorder caused by misfolded proteins called prions. Unlike other dementias, CJD progresses extremely quickly, usually causing death within months.

Characteristics include:

- Rapidly worsening cognitive impairment
- Muscle twitching and involuntary movements
- Vision problems
- Difficulty walking
- Most cases are sporadic (unknown cause)
- Very rare: affects about 1 in 1 million people per year

### Huntington's Disease

**Huntington's disease** is an inherited genetic disorder that causes progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain. It affects movement, thinking, and behavior. Unlike most dementias, it's caused by a specific gene mutation that children of affected parents have a 50% chance of inheriting.

Features include:

- Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea)
- Difficulty with planning and organization
- Personality changes, depression
- Symptoms usually begin in mid-life (30s-50s)
- Genetic testing can predict who will develop the disease

### Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus

**Normal pressure hydrocephalus** (NPH) is caused by buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles, putting pressure on brain tissue. What makes NPH particularly important is that it's one of the few potentially reversible causes of dementia symptoms.

The classic triad of NPH symptoms:

- Walking difficulty (shuffling gait, frequent falls)
- Urinary incontinence or urgency
- Cognitive impairment (slowed thinking, memory problems)

NPH can sometimes be treated by surgically implanting a shunt to drain excess fluid, potentially reversing symptoms if diagnosed early.

!!! tip "Importance of Accurate Diagnosis"
    Because NPH symptoms can mimic Alzheimer's or vascular dementia but are potentially treatable, it's important for doctors to consider this diagnosis, especially when the classic triad of symptoms is present.

## How Doctors Diagnose Different Types

Accurately determining which type of dementia a person has requires careful evaluation. Doctors use a combination of approaches:

**Medical history and physical examination:**
- Detailed symptom timeline
- Medication review
- Family history
- Physical and neurological examination

**Cognitive testing:**
- Memory tests
- Language assessments
- Executive function tests
- Visual-spatial evaluations

**Brain imaging:**
- MRI or CT scans show brain structure and damage patterns
- PET scans can show amyloid deposits or metabolic changes
- Different dementia types have characteristic imaging patterns

**Laboratory tests:**
- Blood tests to rule out reversible causes (vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems)
- Genetic testing in some cases (especially for FTD or Huntington's)

**Specialized tests:**
- Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (can measure amyloid and tau levels)
- Sleep studies (especially for suspected Lewy body dementia)
- Neuropsychological testing (detailed cognitive assessment)

Even with all these tools, diagnosis can be challenging because symptoms overlap and many people have mixed dementia. Doctors often make a "probable" diagnosis based on the most characteristic features, remaining open to revising the diagnosis as more information becomes available.

## Why Knowing the Type Matters

Understanding which type of dementia a person has is important for several reasons:

**Treatment decisions:**
- Some medications work better for specific types
- Avoiding medications that could be harmful (especially important in LBD)
- Targeting vascular risk factors in vascular dementia

**Prognosis and planning:**
- Different types progress at different rates
- Helps families understand what to expect
- Guides advance care planning decisions

**Care strategies:**
- Each type presents unique caregiving challenges
- Behavioral symptoms vary by type
- Safety concerns differ (falls in LBD, wandering in Alzheimer's)

**Research participation:**
- Clinical trials target specific dementia types
- Accurate diagnosis enables appropriate trial enrollment

**Genetic counseling:**
- Particularly important for FTD and Huntington's disease
- Helps family members understand their risk

## Key Takeaways

Let's review the essential concepts about different types of dementia:

- **Dementia is not a single disease** but a syndrome caused by various underlying conditions
- **Alzheimer's disease** is the most common type (60-80%), caused by amyloid plaques and tau tangles, primarily affecting memory first
- **Vascular dementia** results from reduced blood flow to the brain and often shows stepwise decline
- **Lewy body dementia** involves alpha-synuclein deposits and is characterized by fluctuating cognition, hallucinations, and movement problems
- **Frontotemporal dementia** primarily affects personality and behavior before memory, most common in people under 60
- **Mixed dementia** (two or more types together) is more common than previously recognized
- **Cerebrovascular disease** and **mini-strokes** are the underlying causes of vascular dementia
- **Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome** is caused by thiamine deficiency, often related to alcohol misuse
- **Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease** is a rare, rapidly progressive prion disease
- **Huntington's disease** is an inherited genetic disorder affecting movement and cognition
- **Parkinson's disease dementia** develops when cognitive decline occurs years after Parkinson's motor symptoms
- **Normal pressure hydrocephalus** is potentially reversible if caught early and treated with a shunt

In Chapter 4, we'll explore the neuroscience behind neurodegeneration, examining in detail the molecular mechanisms—like amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and abnormal proteins—that cause different types of dementia.
