# Understanding Different Types of Dementia

## Summary

This chapter introduces the major types of dementia and their distinguishing characteristics. You will learn about Alzheimer's disease (the most common form), vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and mixed dementia. The chapter also covers less common forms including cerebrovascular disease, mini-strokes, and rare dementia types such as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Understanding these different types will help you recognize that dementia is not a single disease but rather a collection of conditions with varying causes and presentations.
