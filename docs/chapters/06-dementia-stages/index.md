# Progression Through Dementia Stages

## Summary

This chapter describes how dementia progresses through distinct stages and the changes in personality, behavior, and mood that often accompany the condition. You will learn about the characteristics of early-stage dementia (when symptoms are mild and the person retains considerable independence), moderate-stage dementia (when assistance becomes necessary for daily activities), and late-stage dementia (when round-the-clock care is typically required). Understanding these stages helps families anticipate challenges, plan for future care needs, and recognize what changes are part of the disease progression versus what requires immediate medical attention.
