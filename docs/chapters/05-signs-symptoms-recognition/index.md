# Signs, Symptoms, and Early Recognition

## Summary

You will learn about memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and language difficulties, as well as more specialized symptoms like apraxia (difficulty with motor tasks), agnosia (difficulty recognizing objects), and aphasia (language impairment).
