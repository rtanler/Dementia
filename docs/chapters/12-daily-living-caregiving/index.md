# Chapter 12: Daily Living and Caregiving Skills

## Introduction

Caring for someone with dementia involves providing assistance with everyday activities while preserving their dignity, independence, and quality of life. This chapter focuses on the practical skills caregivers need to support a person with dementia through Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)—the fundamental tasks of self-care that most of us take for granted.

As dementia progresses, individuals gradually lose the ability to perform these tasks independently. However, with the right approach, caregivers can:

- **Maximize remaining abilities**: Support independence rather than taking over completely
- **Preserve dignity**: Respect privacy and maintain self-esteem
- **Reduce anxiety**: Use calm, predictable routines
- **Ensure safety**: Prevent injuries during care activities
- **Promote comfort**: Address physical needs and preferences

**Core Principle**: The goal is not simply to complete tasks efficiently, but to provide care that honors the person's humanity, preserves their sense of self, and maintains their quality of life.

This chapter provides step-by-step guidance for supporting ADLs, establishing routines, managing nutrition and hydration, and implementing comfort measures—all while keeping dignity preservation at the forefront of care.

## Understanding Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)

### What are ADLs?

Activities of Daily Living are the basic self-care tasks essential for independent living. They are divided into two categories:

**Basic ADLs** (BADLs):
- Personal hygiene
- Bathing/showering
- Dressing
- Eating/feeding
- Toileting
- Mobility and transfers

**Instrumental ADLs** (IADLs):
- Meal preparation
- Housework
- Managing medications
- Managing finances
- Shopping
- Using transportation
- Using telephone

**In Dementia**: IADLs are typically affected first, often in early stages. As dementia progresses, basic ADLs become increasingly difficult, requiring more caregiver support.

### Stages of ADL Decline in Dementia

**Early Stage**:
- IADLs affected: Complex tasks like finances, cooking, medication management
- Basic ADLs generally intact: Can still bathe, dress, eat independently
- May need reminders and supervision

**Middle Stage**:
- Basic ADLs require assistance: Needs help with bathing, dressing, grooming
- May forget steps in familiar tasks
- Requires more hands-on support

**Late Stage**:
- Extensive ADL support needed: Total care for all activities
- May be immobile or bedbound
- Requires complete assistance with eating, toileting, hygiene

### Principles of ADL Support

**1. Assess Remaining Abilities**

Before providing help, determine what the person can still do:
- Can they wash their face independently?
- Can they put on a shirt if you hand it to them?
- Can they feed themselves with adapted utensils?

**2. Use a "Do With, Not For" Approach**

- Provide assistance, not complete care
- Break tasks into simple steps
- Allow extra time
- Prompt and guide rather than taking over

**3. Maintain Routines**

- Keep consistent schedule for bathing, meals, bedtime
- Use same sequence of steps each time
- Predictability reduces anxiety

**4. Ensure Safety**

- Remove hazards (slippery floors, sharp objects)
- Use adaptive equipment (grab bars, raised toilet seats)
- Supervise closely during transitions and transfers

**5. Preserve Dignity Always**

- Respect privacy (close doors, cover exposed areas)
- Use calm, respectful communication
- Maintain eye contact at their level
- Honor preferences when possible
- Avoid infantilizing language ("Good girl!" "Let's go potty")

## Personal Hygiene

Personal hygiene includes hand washing, face washing, oral care, and grooming. Maintaining hygiene supports health, comfort, and dignity.

### Challenges in Dementia

- **Forgetting**: May forget how to wash or why it's necessary
- **Sequencing**: Can't remember the steps involved
- **Sensory issues**: Water temperature may feel uncomfortable
- **Resistance**: May refuse care due to confusion or loss of privacy

### Hand Washing

**Why It's Important**: Prevents illness, maintains hygiene, promotes comfort

**How to Assist**:

1. **Lead by example**: Wash your hands while person watches
2. **Use verbal cues**: "Let's wash our hands together"
3. **Demonstrate each step**:
   - Turn on water (check temperature first)
   - "Put your hands under the water"
   - "Pick up the soap"
   - "Rub your hands together"
   - "Rinse the soap off"
   - "Dry your hands"
4. **Hand-over-hand guidance**: Place your hands gently over theirs to guide motions
5. **Make it routine**: Before meals, after toileting, at regular times

**Adaptations**:
- Use liquid soap (easier than bar soap)
- Install lever faucets (easier to operate)
- Use single-temperature faucets to prevent burns
- Pre-moisten washcloth if sink is overwhelming

### Face Washing

**Morning and Evening Routine**:

1. **Prepare supplies**: Warm water in basin, soft washcloth, towel
2. **Explain**: "Let's wash your face"
3. **Check water temperature**: Always test first
4. **Offer washcloth**: See if person can wash own face
5. **Provide assistance as needed**:
   - Gently wash forehead, cheeks, nose, chin
   - Pat dry (don't rub)
   - Apply moisturizer if skin is dry
6. **Respect preferences**: Some prefer cool water, others warm

**Tips**:
- Use unscented products if person is sensitive to smells
- Avoid getting water in eyes
- Be gentle around sensitive areas
- Talk through each step to reduce anxiety

## Bathing Assistance

Bathing is often the most challenging ADL for both people with dementia and their caregivers. It involves privacy concerns, safety risks, and sensory discomfort.

### Why Bathing is Difficult

- **Fear**: Fear of falling, drowning, or the unknown
- **Cold**: Feeling exposed and cold
- **Loss of privacy**: Embarrassment at being naked in front of others
- **Sensory overload**: Water sounds, temperature changes
- **Confusion**: Doesn't understand what's happening
- **Pain**: Arthritis or other conditions make movement painful

### Frequency of Bathing

**Reality**: Daily baths are not necessary and may cause distress.

**Recommendations**:
- Full bath/shower: 2-3 times per week
- Daily: Wash face, hands, underarms, genitals (using washcloth)
- After incontinence: Clean and dry skin thoroughly

**Prioritize comfort and dignity over frequency.**

### Preparing for Bath Time

**Environment**:
- Warm the bathroom beforehand (space heater if needed)
- Reduce noise (turn off fans if loud)
- Ensure good lighting
- Have everything ready before starting
- Remove hazards (throw rugs, cords)

**Supplies Needed**:
- Non-slip bath mat (inside and outside tub/shower)
- Shower chair or bath bench
- Handheld showerhead (easier to control)
- Mild, unscented soap
- Soft washcloths (several)
- Large, warm towels
- Clean clothes laid out
- Any adaptive equipment (grab bars, raised toilet seat)

**Timing**:
- Choose time when person is most calm and rested
- Avoid rushing
- Don't force if highly resistant—try again later
- Use familiar routine

### Step-by-Step Bathing Process

**1. Approach Calmly**

- Choose words carefully: "Let's get cleaned up" rather than "It's time for your bath"
- Be matter-of-fact, not apologetic
- If resistance, try distraction: "After we clean up, we can have tea"

**2. Maintain Privacy and Warmth**

- Keep person covered as much as possible
- Only expose one area at a time
- Use towels to cover non-washing areas
- Start with least invasive areas (hands, arms)

**3. Washing Sequence**

**Preferred method: From least to most private**

1. **Face and neck** (without soap)
2. **Arms and hands**
3. **Chest and abdomen** (keep covered with towel)
4. **Legs and feet**
5. **Back**
6. **Genital area last** (allow person to do this themselves if possible)

**4. Hair Washing**

- Can be done separately on a different day
- Use "no-rinse" shampoo if water is distressing
- Lean person back in shower chair or at sink
- Use handheld showerhead to wet and rinse
- Towel dry hair immediately to prevent chilling

**5. Drying**

- Pat dry thoroughly (don't rub)
- Pay special attention to skin folds (under breasts, between toes, groin)
- Apply lotion to prevent dry skin
- Dress immediately to maintain warmth

### Safety During Bathing

**Fall Prevention**:
- Never leave person alone in bath/shower
- Use non-slip mats
- Install grab bars (securely mounted in studs, not drywall)
- Use shower chair or bath bench
- Transfer in and out safely (see Transfer Techniques section)

**Burn Prevention**:
- Check water temperature with elbow or thermometer (90-105°F/32-40°C)
- Set water heater no higher than 120°F (49°C)
- Turn on cold water first, add hot gradually
- Use single-lever faucets if possible

**Drowning Prevention**:
- Use shallow bath water (4-6 inches)
- Never leave person alone
- Avoid bubble bath (slippery, may cause UTI)

### Alternatives to Traditional Bathing

**Bed Bath**:

For those who cannot get to bathroom:

1. Fill basin with warm water
2. Use washcloths and towels
3. Wash one body part at a time, keeping rest covered
4. Change water when it cools or gets soapy
5. Pat dry and apply lotion

**No-Rinse Products**:
- No-rinse shampoo caps: Pre-moistened caps that clean hair without water
- No-rinse body wash: Apply, lather, towel off (no rinsing needed)
- Pre-moistened bath wipes: For quick clean-up

### Managing Resistance

**If person resists bathing**:

**Don't**:
- Force or argue
- Scold or shame
- Rush
- Give up and never bathe them

**Do**:
- Stay calm
- Try again later (or different day)
- Use distraction and reassurance
- Try different approach (shower vs. bath, morning vs. evening)
- Have different caregiver try
- Break task into smaller steps (face and hands today, rest tomorrow)
- Use music or singing
- Consider professional home health aide

**Validation approach**: "I can see you're upset. We don't have to do this right now. How about we have some tea first?"

## Dressing Assistance

Dressing independently is important for self-esteem and dignity. As dementia progresses, dressing becomes challenging, but strategies can maintain involvement.

### Challenges

- **Sequencing**: Forgets order of clothing (underwear before pants)
- **Motor skills**: Buttons, zippers, snaps become difficult
- **Appropriateness**: May choose seasonal inappropriate clothing
- **Matching**: May not match colors or patterns
- **Modesty**: May undress in public or refuse to dress

### General Principles

**1. Simplify Choices**

- Limit options: Offer 2 outfits, not entire closet
- Remove inappropriate or out-of-season clothes from closet
- Lay out clothes in order to be put on

**2. Simplify Clothing**

- Choose elastic waists over buttons/zippers
- Use Velcro instead of laces
- Front-opening rather than over-the-head
- Slip-on shoes rather than tie shoes
- Avoid small buttons, complicated fasteners

**3. Maintain Preferences**

- Honor lifelong preferences (always wore dresses, never wore jeans)
- Favorite colors and styles
- Comfortable fabrics (avoid scratchy materials)

**4. Safety Considerations**

- Non-slip socks or shoes
- Proper fit (not too loose or tight)
- Remove dangerous items (belts that could strangle, scarves)

### Step-by-Step Dressing Process

**Lay Out Clothes in Order**:

Top to bottom:
1. Underwear (top layer)
2. Undershirt or bra
3. Shirt
4. Pants
5. Socks
6. Shoes (on floor)

**Verbal Cues with Each Item**:

- Hand person item: "Here's your shirt"
- One instruction at a time: "Put your arm in the sleeve"
- If confused, demonstrate on yourself
- Allow time to process each step

**Provide Hand-Over-Hand Assistance as Needed**:

- Guide arms into sleeves
- Help pull pants up (person can stand briefly if able)
- Help with fastenings

**Sequence**:

**Upper Body**:
1. Remove nightwear (top)
2. Put on undershirt or bra
3. Put on shirt
4. If over-the-head: scrunch shirt, stretch opening, guide head through, then arms
5. If button-down: arms in sleeves first, then button (or let person button if able)

**Lower Body**:
1. Remove nightwear (bottom)
2. Put on underwear:
   - Sitting on bed or chair
   - Person steps into leg holes or slide over feet
   - Stand briefly to pull up (provide support)
3. Put on pants same way
4. Put on socks: Pull all the way up to prevent tripping
5. Put on shoes: Non-slip, proper fit

### Tips for Success

**Maintain Dignity**:
- Close door and curtains
- Keep person covered during transitions
- Use calm, respectful tone
- Don't rush
- Allow them to do as much as possible

**Timing**:
- Dress after breakfast (or before, depending on routine)
- Allow extra time (rushing causes stress)
- If resistant, use distraction: "After we get dressed, let's look at photos"

**Encourage Independence**:
- "You start, I'll help if you need it"
- Prompt: "What comes next?"
- Praise efforts: "You're doing great"

### Managing Common Issues

**Wants to Wear Same Clothes Every Day**:
- Buy duplicates of favorite outfit
- Wash clothes at night while person sleeps
- Pick your battles—cleanliness matters more than variety

**Undresses Inappropriately**:
- Use clothing that's difficult to remove (backwards zippers, one-piece outfits)
- Redirect: Offer activity involving hands
- Use validation: "I see you're uncomfortable. Let's go somewhere private"

**Refuses to Change Clothes**:
- Wait until after soiling or bathing
- Use distraction: "Let's get dressed to go see [person/place]"
- Have someone else try
- Choose battles—is this worth the fight?

## Feeding Strategies

Adequate nutrition and hydration are critical for health. As dementia progresses, eating and drinking require increasing support.

### Challenges

- **Forgetting to eat**: Doesn't feel hunger or forgets if already ate
- **Doesn't recognize food**: Can't identify items on plate
- **Lost skills**: Forgets how to use utensils
- **Pocketing**: Holds food in cheeks without swallowing
- **Refusing food**: Turns head away, clamps mouth shut
- **Eating too fast**: Risk of choking
- **Eating non-food items**: May try to eat flowers, soap, etc.

### Creating Supportive Mealtime Environment

**Physical Environment**:
- Quiet, calm space (turn off TV)
- Good lighting
- Comfortable seating (proper height, support)
- Minimal distractions
- Small group or one-on-one

**Table Setting**:
- Simple place setting (reduce clutter)
- Plate, bowl, and cup in contrasting color to table (easier to see)
- Use red or bright colored dishes (may stimulate appetite)
- Non-slip placemat
- One course at a time

### Adapted Utensils and Dishes

**Utensils**:
- Built-up handles (easier to grip)
- Weighted utensils (steadier for tremor)
- Angled/curved spoons
- Spork (combines spoon and fork)

**Dishes**:
- Scoop dishes (high sides help get food on utensil)
- Divided plates (keeps foods separate)
- Non-slip base plates
- Cups with lids and spouts (prevent spills)
- Two-handled cups (easier to grip)

### Mealtime Strategies

**Before the Meal**:
- Offer toileting first
- Ensure comfortable position
- Put on clothing protector (if accepted)—call it "napkin" not "bib"
- Offer hand washing

**Presenting Food**:
- Serve food at appropriate temperature (test first)
- Cut food into bite-sized pieces
- One food item at a time if overwhelmed by full plate
- Describe food if person seems confused: "This is chicken"
- Finger foods if utensils are difficult (see below)

**During the Meal**:
- Sit at eye level
- Eat together (modeling)
- Offer small bites
- Verbal cues: "Take a bite," "Chew," "Swallow"
- Allow adequate time between bites
- Check mouth for pocketing
- Offer sips of liquid to help swallowing
- Watch for signs of choking

**Encouraging Independence**:
- Hand person utensil and guide hand to plate if needed
- Prompt: "Pick up your spoon"
- Use hand-over-hand technique initially, then fade
- Place spoon in hand if person has "forgotten" it's there

### Finger Foods

For those who can no longer use utensils:

**Breakfast**:
- Toast strips
- Pancake strips
- Scrambled egg pieces
- Fruit pieces
- Cheese cubes

**Lunch/Dinner**:
- Sandwiches (quarters)
- Chicken strips
- Meatballs
- Fish sticks
- Cheese cubes
- Steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots)
- Pasta pieces

**Snacks**:
- Crackers with cheese
- Cookies
- Fruit pieces
- Cheese sticks

**Considerations**:
- Foods should be soft enough to chew easily
- Avoid foods that crumble (choking risk)
- Watch for over-stuffing mouth

### Managing Eating Difficulties

**Refuses to Open Mouth**:
- Try different food or temperature
- Use gentle touch on lips or chin to cue
- Model: Open your own mouth
- Try small spoon or putting food on finger
- Don't force—try again later

**Pockets Food**:
- Check inside cheeks after each bite
- Prompt: "Swallow your food"
- Offer sip of liquid
- Gently massage throat (downward motion) to cue swallow
- Smaller bites

**Eats Too Fast**:
- Serve small amounts at a time
- Remove plate between bites
- Offer one bite at a time from your hand
- Verbal pacing: "Chew slowly," "Take your time"

**Spits Food Out**:
- May not like taste or texture
- May be too hot or cold
- Try different foods
- May need pureed consistency

**Eats Very Slowly**:
- May take 45-60 minutes—allow adequate time
- Keep food warm (insulated plate, warming tray)
- Offer smaller, more frequent meals

**Refuses to Eat**:
- Try different foods, times, settings
- Offer favorite foods
- Have someone else try feeding
- Rule out medical issues (pain, constipation, dental problems)
- Contact doctor if refusal continues

### Swallowing Difficulties (Dysphagia)

**Warning Signs**:
- Coughing during eating or drinking
- Wet, gurgly voice after swallowing
- Pocketing food
- Taking very long to chew and swallow
- Drooling
- Weight loss
- Recurrent pneumonia

**If Suspected**:
- Consult doctor and speech therapist
- Swallow evaluation may be needed
- Diet modifications may be required (see below)

**Modified Diets** (prescribed by speech therapist):

1. **Regular**: Normal food and liquids
2. **Soft/Mechanical Soft**: Soft textures, no tough meats or raw vegetables
3. **Minced/Ground**: Ground meats, soft vegetables
4. **Pureed**: Smooth, pudding-like consistency

**Thickened Liquids** (to prevent aspiration):
- Thin (normal)
- Nectar-thick
- Honey-thick
- Pudding-thick (spoon-thick)

## Toileting Support

Maintaining toileting independence as long as possible is important for dignity. As dementia progresses, support is needed.

### Challenges

- **Forgetting where bathroom is**: Can't find it in time
- **Forgetting why they're there**: Gets to bathroom but forgets purpose
- **Forgetting steps**: Doesn't know what to do
- **Not recognizing urge**: Loses sensation of needing to go
- **Incontinence**: Loses bladder/bowel control

### Promoting Independence

**Environmental Modifications**:
- Clear path to bathroom (remove obstacles)
- Night lights for evening trips
- Sign on bathroom door (picture of toilet)
- Leave bathroom door open (easier to see)
- Paint toilet seat different color from floor (easier to see)
- Install grab bars
- Use raised toilet seat (easier to sit/stand)

**Clothing Modifications**:
- Elastic waists (easy to pull down)
- Avoid complex fasteners
- Pants in contrasting color to underwear (see difference)

### Toileting Schedule

**Prompted voiding** (scheduled toileting):

- Take to bathroom every 2-3 hours
- After meals
- Before and after sleep
- Before leaving house
- Before activities

**Even if person says they don't need to go, encourage trying.**

**Routine**:
1. **Approach calmly**: "Let's take a bathroom break"
2. **Lead to bathroom**: Take arm gently
3. **Provide privacy** but stay nearby
4. **Verbal cues**: "Pull down your pants," "Sit down," "Try to go"
5. **Allow adequate time**: Don't rush
6. **Assist with wiping** if needed (front to back for women)
7. **Help pull up pants**
8. **Wash hands together**

### Managing Incontinence

(See separate Incontinence Management section below for detailed information)

**Key Points**:
- Incontinence is common in later stages
- Not a sign of laziness or spite
- Medical evaluation needed to rule out treatable causes
- Scheduled toileting can reduce accidents
- Protective products available

## Mobility Assistance and Transfer Techniques

Safe mobility and transfers are critical to prevent falls and injuries for both the person with dementia and the caregiver.

### Assessing Mobility Level

**Independent**: Walks without assistance
**Supervision**: Walks but needs someone nearby for safety
**Minimal Assistance**: Needs hand-hold or touch support
**Moderate Assistance**: Needs significant physical support
**Dependent**: Cannot walk; requires wheelchair or is bedbound

**Always assess before attempting transfers.**

### General Safety Principles

**For Person with Dementia**:
- Non-slip footwear (not socks alone)
- Proper-fitting clothing (not too long)
- Clear walkways (no cords, throw rugs, clutter)
- Good lighting
- Grab bars installed in bathroom, hallways

**For Caregiver**:
- Use proper body mechanics (bend knees, not back)
- Get close to person (don't reach)
- Use gait belt for safety
- Get help for heavy transfers
- Use mechanical lifts if available

### Gait Belts

A gait belt is a sturdy fabric belt worn around person's waist to provide secure handhold during transfers and walking.

**How to Use**:
1. Thread belt through buckle
2. Place around person's waist (over clothing, not bare skin)
3. Position buckle off-center (not on spine)
4. Tighten so it's snug but comfortable (should fit 2-3 fingers between belt and body)
5. Hold belt with underhand grip from back or side
6. Never use to lift person—use for stability and guidance

### Transfer Techniques

**Sitting to Standing**

**1. Sit-to-Stand from Chair**:

1. Person sitting at edge of chair, feet flat on floor
2. Apply gait belt
3. Stand directly in front, feet shoulder-width apart
4. Caregiver places one foot between person's feet, one foot back
5. Person leans forward ("nose over toes")
6. Person places hands on armrests
7. Count: "One, two, three, stand!"
8. Person pushes up from armrests while caregiver provides support via gait belt and possibly under arms
9. Once standing, ensure person is stable before walking

**Alternative method if person can't push up**:
- Use standing pivot transfer (see below)
- Consider using mechanical lift

**2. Standing Pivot Transfer** (chair to wheelchair, wheelchair to bed, etc.):

1. Position wheelchair or receiving surface at 45-degree angle
2. Lock wheelchair brakes
3. Remove footrests and armrest (if possible) on transfer side
4. Assist person to stand (as above)
5. Person places hands on caregiver's shoulders (or gait belt)
6. Caregiver holds gait belt
7. Person pivots (small steps) until backs of knees touch receiving surface
8. Person sits slowly while caregiver guides and controls descent

**3. Bed-to-Chair Transfer**:

1. Raise bed to appropriate height (person's feet touch floor when sitting)
2. Person sits at edge of bed
3. Place chair/wheelchair close, at angle
4. Lock brakes
5. Apply gait belt
6. Assist to stand (as above)
7. Pivot and sit in chair

**4. Car Transfer**:

1. Person stands next to open car door, back to seat
2. Person sits on edge of seat
3. Pivot body into car
4. Lift legs into car (one at a time, or both together)
5. Fasten seatbelt

**Getting out**: Reverse process

### Walking Assistance

**With Gait Belt**:
- Walk slightly behind and to the side
- Hold gait belt with one hand, person's arm with other (if needed)
- Match person's pace (don't rush)
- Provide verbal cues: "Small steps," "Lift your feet"

**With Walker or Cane**:
- Ensure walker/cane is proper height (wrists level when standing upright)
- Walker should have rubber tips and be in good condition
- Person should look forward, not down
- Small steps

**Preventing Falls**:
- Clear walkways
- Non-slip surfaces
- Adequate lighting
- Handrails on both sides of stairs
- Rest breaks as needed
- Never leave person standing alone

### When Person Falls

**Don't try to catch or lift during fall—risk of injury to both**

**After a Fall**:

1. **Stay calm**
2. **Assess for injury**:
   - Ask if person has pain
   - Check for bleeding, bruising, deformity
   - Don't move if suspected fracture
   - Call 911 if serious injury or can't help person up
3. **If no apparent injury**:
   - Let person rest briefly
   - Get sturdy chair
   - Help person roll to side, then to hands and knees
   - Help to crawl to chair
   - One leg up (stronger side), place hands on chair
   - Push up to standing using chair for support
   - Sit in chair
4. **Monitor**: Watch for delayed symptoms (pain, confusion)
5. **Report to doctor**

**Prevention after fall**:
- Physical therapy evaluation
- Home safety assessment
- Review medications
- Increase supervision

## Sleep Hygiene

Quality sleep is important for both the person with dementia and the caregiver. Sleep disturbances are common in dementia but can be managed.

### Common Sleep Problems

- Difficulty falling asleep
- Frequent nighttime awakening
- Wandering at night
- Day-night reversal (sleeping during day, awake at night)
- Sundowning (increased confusion and agitation in late afternoon/evening)

### Causes

- Pain or discomfort
- Need to use bathroom
- Medication side effects
- Too much daytime napping
- Lack of physical activity
- Disrupted circadian rhythm
- Sleep apnea
- Anxiety or fear

### Promoting Good Sleep

**Sleep Schedule**:
- Consistent bedtime and wake time (even weekends)
- Limit daytime naps (no more than 30 minutes, not after 3 PM)
- Wake person if sleeping too much during day

**Daytime Activity**:
- Encourage physical exercise (morning or early afternoon)
- Expose to natural light (especially morning)
- Provide stimulating activities during day
- Avoid strenuous activity in evening

**Evening Routine**:
- Calm, quiet activities
- Dim lights as evening progresses
- Avoid stimulating TV shows or activities
- Light snack (complex carbs—small bowl of oatmeal, toast)
- Warm milk or herbal tea (avoid caffeine)
- Toileting before bed

**Bedtime Routine** (same sequence every night):
- Personal care (face washing, teeth brushing)
- Change into sleepwear
- Toileting
- Comfortable positioning in bed
- Gentle music or white noise
- Night light (not too bright)
- Reassuring words: "Good night, I'll see you in the morning. I'm right down the hall."

**Bedroom Environment**:
- Comfortable temperature (cooler better than warmer)
- Dark (blackout curtains if needed)
- Quiet (white noise machine if environmental noise)
- Comfortable mattress and pillows
- Safe (no tripping hazards, clear path to bathroom)

**Safety at Night**:
- Night lights along path to bathroom
- Bed alarm or motion sensor if person wanders
- Baby monitor to hear if person gets up
- Remove clutter
- Lock doors/windows if wandering risk

### Managing Nighttime Waking

**If Person Wakes and Calls Out**:
- Go to them calmly
- Speak softly and reassuringly
- Assess: "What do you need?"
- Address need (bathroom, pain, repositioning)
- Use calm, gentle redirection back to sleep
- Avoid turning on bright lights
- Avoid engaging in stimulating conversation
- Stay briefly, then encourage sleep

**If Person Wanders**:
- Ensure safety (locks on exterior doors, alarms)
- Guide back to bed calmly
- Offer toilet, water, reassurance
- Return to bed
- May need to let person walk briefly to expend energy

**Avoid**:
- Arguing or reasoning ("It's nighttime, you need to sleep")
- Turning on bright lights
- Stimulating activities
- Large meals or drinks (need to urinate)
- Scolding

## Daily Routines

Establishing and maintaining consistent daily routines reduces anxiety, promotes independence, and provides structure and predictability.

### Why Routines Matter in Dementia

- **Reduces confusion**: Predictability provides security
- **Supports remaining abilities**: Familiar patterns are easier to follow
- **Decreases challenging behaviors**: Less anxiety and uncertainty
- **Provides rhythm**: Natural flow to the day
- **Easier for caregivers**: Less resistance and negotiation

### Creating a Daily Routine

**Morning**:
- Wake at same time
- Toileting
- Personal hygiene (face, teeth)
- Dressing
- Breakfast
- Light activity or exercise
- Medication

**Midday**:
- Activity (craft, music, walk)
- Lunch
- Quiet time or short rest
- Activity (social, cognitive stimulation)
- Snack

**Afternoon**:
- Activity (avoid strenuous as day progresses)
- Early dinner (5-6 PM)
- Medication
- Calm activity (puzzles, photos)

**Evening**:
- Personal hygiene
- Change into sleepwear
- Toileting
- Calming activity (music, TV)
- Bedtime routine (same time each night)

**Key Principles**:

1. **Consistency**: Same activities at same times
2. **Flexibility**: Allow for bad days, medical appointments
3. **Individualized**: Based on person's preferences and abilities
4. **Balanced**: Mix active/passive, social/solitary, indoor/outdoor
5. **Meaningful**: Include activities person enjoys and can succeed at
6. **Paced**: Build in rest periods, don't overschedule

### Tips for Successful Routines

**Visual Schedule**:
- Create picture schedule showing day's activities
- Cross off or move indicator as day progresses
- Helps with orientation and reduces repeated questioning

**Transitions**:
- Give advance warning: "In 10 minutes, we'll have lunch"
- Use consistent phrases: "Time for breakfast" every morning
- Allow time between activities (no rushing)

**When Routine is Disrupted**:
- Return to routine as soon as possible
- Provide extra reassurance
- May see increased confusion or agitation—be patient

## Meal Planning, Nutrition, and Hydration Management

Adequate nutrition and hydration are fundamental to health and well-being. Dementia affects eating and drinking in multiple ways.

### Nutritional Needs

**General Guidelines**:
- **Calories**: May need 1,800-2,400/day depending on activity level
- **Protein**: Important for maintaining muscle mass
- **Fiber**: Prevents constipation
- **Calcium and Vitamin D**: Bone health
- **Fluids**: 6-8 cups per day minimum

**In Later Stages**:
- Calorie needs may increase (wandering, restlessness)
- Weight loss common—may need calorie-dense foods
- Supplements may be needed (discuss with doctor)

### Meal Planning Strategies

**Plan Simple, Nutritious Meals**:
- Focus on whole foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein)
- Include favorite foods
- Consistent meal times
- Three meals plus 2-3 snacks

**Make Meals Appealing**:
- Colorful presentation
- Variety of textures
- Familiar foods
- Appropriate portion sizes (not overwhelming)

**Foods to Emphasize**:
- Soft, moist foods (easier to chew and swallow)
- High-protein: eggs, fish, poultry, beans, dairy
- Fruits and vegetables: varied colors and types
- Whole grains: oatmeal, brown rice, whole wheat bread
- Healthy fats: olive oil, nuts, avocados, fatty fish

**Foods to Limit**:
- Hard, dry, crumbly foods (choking risk)
- Tough meats
- Processed foods high in sodium
- Sugary foods (empty calories)
- Caffeine (late in day)

### Addressing Poor Appetite

**Causes**:
- Medications
- Depression
- Constipation
- Dental problems
- Decreased taste/smell
- Fatigue

**Strategies**:
- Offer small, frequent meals (5-6 per day)
- Include favorite foods
- Enhance flavors with herbs and spices
- Offer nutritious snacks
- Make meals social
- Ensure adequate physical activity (stimulates appetite)
- Address underlying causes (dental care, constipation management)

### Hydration Management

**Why Hydration is Critical**:
- Prevents UTIs
- Prevents constipation
- Supports cognitive function
- Maintains skin integrity
- Regulates body temperature

**Signs of Dehydration**:
- Dark urine
- Decreased urination
- Dry mouth and lips
- Sunken eyes
- Confusion (worse than baseline)
- Dizziness
- Rapid heart rate

### Encouraging Fluid Intake

**Goal**: 6-8 cups (48-64 ounces) per day

**Strategies**:
- Offer fluids frequently (every 1-2 hours)
- Provide variety: water, juice, milk, herbal tea, broth
- Use see-through cups (can see liquid level)
- Use cups with lids and straws (easier, less spilling)
- Offer small amounts throughout day
- Include high-water foods: watermelon, cucumbers, soup, smoothies, popsicles, gelatin
- Keep water within reach (but monitor—may spill)
- Model: Drink together
- Flavor water with fruit slices if person finds it boring

**Avoid**:
- Excessive caffeine (diuretic)
- Alcohol (dehydrating)
- Large amounts at once (overwhelming, increases toileting frequency)

**Monitor**:
- Track fluid intake (use chart)
- Note urine color and frequency
- Watch for signs of dehydration
- Contact doctor if concerns

## Dental Care

Oral health affects nutrition, comfort, overall health, and dignity. Dementia makes dental care challenging, but it's essential.

### Why Dental Care Matters

- **Prevents pain**: Tooth decay, gum disease cause discomfort
- **Supports nutrition**: Painful teeth make eating difficult
- **Prevents infection**: Oral bacteria can lead to serious infections
- **Maintains dignity**: Clean mouth feels good, reduces bad breath
- **Prevents tooth loss**: Preserves ability to eat solid foods

### Daily Oral Hygiene Routine

**Tooth Brushing (2x daily: morning and bedtime)**:

**Supplies**:
- Soft-bristled toothbrush (or electric toothbrush)
- Fluoride toothpaste
- Cup of water
- Towel

**Steps**:
1. Have person sit or stand at sink
2. Demonstrate brushing on yourself
3. Put pea-sized amount of toothpaste on brush
4. Hand brush to person: "Brush your teeth"
5. **If person can do it**:
   - Supervise and prompt as needed
   - May need verbal cues for each step
6. **If person needs assistance**:
   - Stand beside and slightly behind
   - Gently guide hand holding brush
   - Brush all surfaces: front, back, chewing surfaces
   - Gentle circular motions
   - Brush tongue
7. Rinse: "Spit into the sink"
8. Wipe mouth with towel

**Tips**:
- Use child-friendly toothpaste (less irritating if swallowed)
- Sing or play music during brushing
- Break task into small steps
- If resistance, try different times, or offer break and try again

**For Those Who Resist**:
- Try flavored toothpaste
- Use finger brush or gauze-wrapped finger
- Use toothbrush dipped in mouthwash or water (without toothpaste)
- Brush after meals when mouth is already open
- Have someone else try

### Denture Care

**If Person Has Dentures**:

**Daily Cleaning**:
1. Remove dentures after meals
2. Rinse under running water
3. Brush with denture brush and denture cleaner (not regular toothpaste—too abrasive)
4. Rinse thoroughly
5. Soak overnight in denture solution
6. Rinse before reinserting in morning

**Fit Check**:
- Dentures should fit snugly without adhesive
- Loose dentures cause sores
- Poor fit makes eating difficult
- See dentist for adjustments

**Oral Care Even with Dentures**:
- Brush gums, tongue, palate with soft toothbrush
- Rinse mouth after meals

### Professional Dental Care

**Regular Dental Visits**:
- Every 6 months (or as recommended by dentist)
- Find dementia-friendly dentist
- Bring list of medications
- Provide dentist with information about dementia stage and communication strategies

**What to Watch For**:
- Refusing food (may indicate dental pain)
- Holding hand to mouth
- Changes in eating patterns
- Bad breath
- Swollen, red gums
- Loose teeth
- Facial swelling

**Emergency**: If signs of dental abscess (severe pain, swelling, fever), seek immediate care.

## Incontinence Management

Urinary and bowel incontinence are common in later stages of dementia. While distressing, they can be managed with dignity and compassion.

### Types of Incontinence

**Urinary Incontinence**:
- **Urge incontinence**: Sudden strong urge, can't reach bathroom in time
- **Functional incontinence**: Can't get to bathroom or manage clothing fast enough
- **Overflow incontinence**: Bladder doesn't empty completely
- **Total incontinence**: Complete loss of bladder control

**Bowel Incontinence**:
- Less common than urinary
- Usually occurs in later stages

### Causes

**Dementia-Related**:
- Forgets where bathroom is
- Doesn't recognize urge to go
- Forgets what to do in bathroom
- Can't manage clothing quickly enough

**Medical** (treatable):
- Urinary tract infection (UTI)
- Constipation (can cause urinary incontinence)
- Medications (diuretics)
- Diabetes
- Prostate problems (men)

**Always rule out treatable causes before assuming it's dementia-related.**

### Prevention Strategies

**Scheduled Toileting** (see Toileting section):
- Take to bathroom every 2-3 hours
- Before and after meals
- Before leaving house
- Before bed and upon waking
- Even if person says they don't need to go

**Environmental Modifications**:
- Clear path to bathroom
- Sign on door
- Night lights
- Grab bars, raised toilet seat
- Easy-to-remove clothing

**Fluid Management**:
- Adequate fluids during day (don't restrict—worsens problems)
- Limit fluids 2 hours before bedtime
- Avoid caffeine (bladder irritant)

**Bowel Routine**:
- High-fiber diet
- Adequate fluids
- Regular physical activity
- Scheduled time after meals (gastrocolic reflex)
- Stool softener if needed (per doctor)

### When Accidents Happen

**React Calmly**:
- Don't scold, shame, or express disgust
- Stay matter-of-fact: "Let's get you cleaned up"
- Reassure: "It's okay, these things happen"

**Clean-Up Process**:

**Urinary**:
1. Help person to bathroom or bedroom
2. Remove wet clothing
3. Clean genital area thoroughly with disposable wipes (front to back for women)
4. Pat dry
5. Apply barrier cream if skin irritated
6. Help into clean, dry clothing
7. Wash hands

**Bowel**:
1. Remove soiled clothing carefully
2. Place in plastic bag
3. Clean genital and perianal area thoroughly with wipes
4. Pat dry
5. Apply barrier cream
6. Help into clean clothing
7. Wash hands thoroughly

**Laundry**:
- Rinse soiled items in cold water
- Use enzymatic cleaner
- Wash separately in hot water with detergent
- May need to wash twice
- Dry thoroughly

### Protective Products

**Types Available**:

**Absorbent Underwear** ("pull-ups"):
- Look like regular underwear
- For light to moderate incontinence
- Person can pull up and down like regular underwear
- More dignity-preserving

**Adult Diapers** (briefs with tabs):
- For moderate to heavy incontinence
- Easier to change for bedridden or immobile persons
- Require lying down to change

**Pads/Liners**:
- For very light incontinence
- Wear inside regular underwear
- Disposable or reusable

**Sizing**: Critical for preventing leaks—measure and follow size chart

**When to Change**:
- Check every 2-3 hours
- Change immediately after bowel movement
- Change when wet (prolonged contact causes skin breakdown)
- Before bed, immediately upon waking

**Disposal**:
- Wrap in plastic bag
- Dispose in covered trash can (empty daily)

### Skin Care with Incontinence

**Preventing Breakdown**:
- Change products promptly
- Clean and dry skin thoroughly after each change
- Apply barrier cream (zinc oxide, petroleum jelly)
- Expose skin to air when possible
- Use gentle, fragrance-free products

**Signs of Skin Problems**:
- Redness
- Rash
- Painful, open areas
- Odor

**If skin breakdown occurs**: Consult doctor or wound care nurse

### Managing Caregiver Feelings

Incontinence care is one of the hardest aspects of caregiving. Feelings of disgust, sadness, frustration are normal.

**Remember**:
- Person cannot control this
- Person is likely embarrassed and upset too
- This is a symptom of disease, not behavioral
- You're providing compassionate care
- It's okay to take breaks and ask for help
- Consider home health aide for assistance

---

## Skin Care

Healthy skin is essential for comfort and preventing serious complications. People with dementia are at risk for skin problems.

### Risks

- Immobility
- Incontinence
- Poor nutrition/hydration
- Aging skin (fragile, dry)
- Decreased sensation (may not feel discomfort)

### Daily Skin Care

**Inspection** (daily):
- Check entire body during bathing or dressing
- Look for redness, rashes, pressure areas, bruising, wounds
- Pay special attention to:
  - Bony prominences (heels, sacrum, hips, elbows, back of head)
  - Skin folds (under breasts, groin, between toes)
  - Areas exposed to moisture (incontinence)

**Cleansing**:
- Daily bathing or sponge bath
- Use mild, non-soap cleanser
- Pat dry thoroughly (don't rub)
- Dry skin folds completely

**Moisturizing**:
- Apply lotion daily (after bathing while skin slightly damp)
- Use fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products
- Focus on dry areas (elbows, heels, hands)
- Don't apply between toes (can cause fungal infection)

### Pressure Injury Prevention

**Pressure injuries** (also called bedsores, pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers) are damage to skin and underlying tissue from prolonged pressure.

**Most Common Sites**:
- Sacrum (tailbone)
- Heels
- Hips
- Elbows
- Back of head
- Shoulder blades
- Spine

**Risk Factors**:
- Immobility
- Bedbound or wheelchair-bound
- Poor nutrition
- Incontinence
- Thin or fragile skin
- Decreased sensation

**Prevention** (see Positioning section below for details):
- Frequent position changes (every 2 hours if bedbound)
- Pressure-relieving cushions and mattresses
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Adequate nutrition and hydration
- Inspect skin daily
- Avoid friction and shearing during transfers

**Stages**:

- **Stage 1**: Non-blanchable redness (doesn't turn white when pressed)
- **Stage 2**: Partial-thickness skin loss (looks like blister or shallow crater)
- **Stage 3**: Full-thickness skin loss (crater, may see fat)
- **Stage 4**: Full-thickness tissue loss (deep crater, may see muscle, bone)

**If pressure injury develops**: Contact doctor immediately. Early treatment prevents worsening.

### Skin Tears and Bruising

**Prevention**:
- Handle gently
- Avoid bumping into furniture
- Remove jewelry that could scratch
- Trim fingernails
- Use long sleeves if person scratches self
- Pad bed rails or wheelchair arms

**If Skin Tear Occurs**:
- Clean gently with saline or water
- Pat dry
- Apply non-adherent dressing
- Seek medical care for large tears or if signs of infection

---

## Positioning

Proper positioning is critical for comfort, preventing complications, and supporting function.

### For Bedbound Individuals

**Turning and Repositioning** (every 2 hours):

**Why It's Important**:
- Prevents pressure injuries
- Prevents pneumonia (promotes lung expansion)
- Improves circulation
- Provides comfort
- Reduces contractures (joint stiffness)

**Positions**:

**Supine** (on back):
- Head elevated 30-45 degrees (prevents aspiration)
- Small pillow under knees
- Pillows supporting arms
- Heels elevated off bed (pillow under calves, not under knees)

**Side-Lying** (on side):
- Pillow under head
- Top leg bent, supported on pillow
- Pillow between knees
- Top arm supported on pillow
- Back supported with rolled towel or pillow (30-degree angle, not 90)

**Fowler's Position** (sitting up in bed):
- Head elevated 45-60 degrees
- Knees slightly bent
- Pillows supporting arms
- Used for meals, activities

**Rotate positions**: Back → right side → back → left side

**Special Equipment**:
- **Pressure-relieving mattress**: Foam, air, or alternating pressure
- **Heel protectors**: Boots or cushions
- **Positioning wedges**: Support proper alignment
- **Bed cradle**: Keeps blankets off feet

### For Wheelchair Users

**Proper Positioning**:
- Feet flat on footrests (adjust height)
- Hips all the way back in chair
- Knees at 90 degrees
- Back supported
- Arms supported on armrests

**Pressure Relief**:
- Shift weight every 15-30 minutes (or assist person to shift)
- Use pressure-relieving cushion
- Stand or transfer every 2 hours

**Proper Fit**:
- Chair should fit person properly
- Too wide: person slides to side
- Too narrow: rubs hips
- Occupational therapist can assess fit

### Preventing Contractures

**Contractures** are permanent tightening of muscles, tendons, and joints, causing deformity and loss of motion.

**Prevention**:
- Frequent position changes
- Range of motion exercises (see below)
- Proper positioning (avoid prolonged flexion)
- Splints or braces if ordered by therapist

**Range of Motion (ROM) Exercises**:

Gently move each joint through its full range of motion:
- **Shoulders**: Raise arms overhead, out to sides, across body
- **Elbows**: Bend and straighten
- **Wrists**: Bend up, down, side to side, rotate
- **Fingers**: Open and close, spread apart
- **Hips**: Bend knee to chest, out to side, rotate
- **Knees**: Bend and straighten
- **Ankles**: Point toes up, down, circles

**How Often**: 2-3 times daily (during dressing, bathing)

**Tips**:
- Move slowly and gently
- Support joints
- Stop if person has pain
- Physical therapist can teach proper technique

---

## Comfort Measures

## Key Takeaways

1. **Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)** are the fundamental self-care tasks that become increasingly difficult as dementia progresses, requiring caregiver support while maximizing remaining abilities.

2. **"Do with, not for"** is the core principle—provide assistance and guidance rather than taking over completely, preserving independence and dignity.

3. **Consistent routines** reduce anxiety, support remaining abilities, and make care easier for both person and caregiver. Same activities at same times in same sequence.

4. **Bathing challenges** can be addressed through warm environment, privacy, explaining each step, covering with towels, and using calm reassurance. Daily baths aren't necessary.

5. **Dressing support** involves simplifying choices and clothing, laying out clothes in order, providing step-by-step verbal cues, and allowing adequate time.

6. **Feeding strategies** include creating calm mealtime environment, using adapted equipment, offering finger foods, and providing verbal cues for each step of eating.

7. **Scheduled toileting** every 2-3 hours prevents incontinence accidents and supports dignity. Environmental modifications help wayfinding.

8. **Safe transfers** require proper body mechanics, gait belts, clear communication, and assessing mobility level before attempting. Get help when needed.

9. **Sleep hygiene** involves consistent schedule, daytime activity, calming evening routine, and comfortable bedroom environment to reduce nighttime waking.

10. **Adequate nutrition and hydration** are critical. Offer small, frequent meals; encourage fluids throughout day; monitor for dehydration signs.

11. **Dental care** prevents pain and supports nutrition. Daily brushing, regular dental visits, and denture care maintain oral health.

12. **Incontinence management** requires scheduled toileting, immediate clean-up, protective products, and excellent skin care to prevent breakdown.

13. **Skin inspection daily** identifies problems early. Frequent position changes (every 2 hours if bedbound) prevent pressure injuries.

14. **Comfort assessment** requires careful observation in those who can't communicate. Address pain, position, temperature, sensory needs, and emotional comfort.

15. **Dignity preservation** must be the foundation of all care activities—respect privacy, support autonomy, communicate respectfully, honor the person beyond the disease.
