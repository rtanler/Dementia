# Communication Techniques

## Summary

This chapter focuses on effective communication strategies for interacting with someone who has dementia. You will learn techniques for both verbal and non-verbal communication, including the importance of active listening, using simple language, incorporating visual cues, and exercising patience. The chapter covers validation techniques (accepting the person's reality rather than correcting them), redirection strategies for difficult situations, and the use of communication boards when verbal skills decline. Understanding body language—both the person's and your own—is also explored. As language abilities deteriorate with dementia progression, these communication techniques become increasingly important for maintaining connection, reducing frustration, and providing compassionate care.
