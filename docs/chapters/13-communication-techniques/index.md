# Chapter 13: Communication Techniques

## Introduction

Communication is the foundation of human connection. For people living with dementia, communication abilities gradually decline as the disease progresses, but the need and desire to connect with others remains. Effective communication techniques can reduce frustration, preserve dignity, maintain relationships, and improve quality of life for both the person with dementia and their caregivers.

This chapter explores ten essential communication concepts that will help you maintain meaningful connections throughout the dementia journey. You'll learn not just what to say, but how to say it—and when words alone aren't enough, how to communicate through actions, expressions, and presence.

## The Importance of Communication in Dementia Care

**Why Communication Matters**:

- **Preserves personhood**: Effective communication acknowledges the person behind the disease
- **Reduces behavioral challenges**: Many challenging behaviors stem from communication frustration
- **Maintains relationships**: Good communication helps preserve connections with loved ones
- **Supports autonomy**: Enables the person to express preferences and maintain some control
- **Enhances quality of life**: Feeling heard and understood contributes to wellbeing
- **Reduces caregiver stress**: Successful communication makes caregiving less frustrating

**The Progressive Nature of Communication Changes**:

Dementia affects different aspects of communication at different stages:

- **Early stage**: Word-finding difficulties, repetition, losing train of thought
- **Middle stage**: Difficulty understanding complex sentences, mixing up words, reduced vocabulary
- **Late stage**: Very limited verbal communication, reliance on non-verbal communication

Despite these changes, the person's emotional awareness often remains intact longer than verbal abilities. A warm tone and gentle touch may communicate more than words.

## 1. Verbal Communication

Verbal communication—the words we use and how we say them—is often the first thing we think about in conversation. With dementia, how you speak becomes as important as what you say.

### Elements of Effective Verbal Communication

**Tone of Voice**:
- Use a warm, friendly, respectful tone
- Speak as you would to any adult (not as to a child)
- Keep your voice calm and reassuring, especially during stressful moments
- Avoid speaking in a loud or harsh tone unless hearing is impaired

**Volume and Pace**:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate volume (louder only if hearing-impaired)
- Slow down your pace slightly, but don't talk unnaturally slowly
- Pause between sentences to allow processing time
- Don't rush through what you're saying

**Word Choice**:
- Use familiar, everyday words
- Be specific and concrete rather than abstract
- Say "Would you like to eat now?" instead of "Are you hungry?"
- Use names instead of pronouns ("Let's go to the bathroom" not "Let's go there")

### Verbal Communication Strategies by Stage

**Early Stage**:
- Mostly normal conversation is possible
- Give the person extra time to find words
- Provide the word if they're struggling (gently)
- Don't finish every sentence for them

**Middle Stage**:
- Simplify language (see Simple Language section)
- Break information into smaller pieces
- Repeat key information as needed
- Focus on one topic at a time

**Late Stage**:
- Use short, simple sentences or phrases
- Focus on key words ("Time for lunch")
- Use repetition and routine phrases
- Don't assume they can't understand—assume they can

### Common Verbal Communication Mistakes

**DON'T**:
- Use baby talk or elderspeak ("Let's go potty!")
- Talk about the person as if they're not there
- Argue, correct, or contradict
- Ask them to remember something they've forgotten
- Use sarcasm or humor they might not understand
- Give multiple choices or complex instructions

**DO**:
- Speak in a normal adult tone
- Include the person in conversations
- Agree and validate their reality
- Offer information without demanding recall
- Use gentle, obvious humor
- Provide one simple option at a time

## 2. Non-Verbal Communication

Research shows that up to 93% of communication is non-verbal—through facial expressions, gestures, posture, and tone. For people with dementia, non-verbal communication becomes increasingly important as verbal skills decline.

### Your Non-Verbal Communication

**Facial Expressions**:
- Maintain a pleasant, relaxed expression
- Smile warmly and naturally
- Show interest and attention
- Avoid frowning, rolling eyes, or looking frustrated
- Your face should match your words (don't smile while delivering bad news)

**Eye Contact**:
- Make gentle, warm eye contact
- Get to their eye level (sit or kneel if they're seated)
- Don't stare intensely or avoid eye contact
- For some individuals, less eye contact may be more comfortable

**Gestures**:
- Use natural hand gestures to support your words
- Point to objects you're talking about
- Demonstrate actions (show them how to use a spoon)
- Keep gestures calm and not overly dramatic

**Posture and Positioning**:
- Approach from the front, not from behind
- Face the person directly
- Maintain a relaxed, open posture
- Keep your body language calm and unhurried
- Sit or stand at their level

**Physical Proximity**:
- Stand or sit at a comfortable distance (about arm's length)
- Respect personal space, but don't be distant
- In late stages, closer proximity may be comforting
- Watch for signs they want more or less space

### Reading Their Non-Verbal Communication

**Facial Expressions**:
- Look for signs of pain, fear, confusion, or pleasure
- A furrowed brow may indicate pain or worry
- Smiles and relaxed features suggest comfort
- Blank expressions may indicate lack of understanding

**Body Language**:
- Crossed arms may indicate resistance or discomfort
- Leaning forward suggests interest
- Pulling away may mean they need space
- Restlessness may signal discomfort or need

**Vocalizations**:
- Tone of voice (even if words don't make sense)
- Sighs, groans, or sounds of distress
- Humming or singing may indicate contentment

## 3. Active Listening

Active listening means fully focusing on the person, understanding their message, and showing that you're listening. It's about being present, not just waiting for your turn to talk.

### Components of Active Listening

**Give Full Attention**:
- Put away distractions (phone, TV remote)
- Stop other activities and focus on the person
- Turn your body toward them
- Make eye contact

**Show You're Listening**:
- Nod occasionally
- Use brief verbal acknowledgments ("I see," "Mm-hmm," "Yes")
- Lean forward slightly
- Maintain an interested facial expression

**Provide Feedback**:
- Reflect back what you heard: "It sounds like you're worried about..."
- Ask clarifying questions: "Tell me more about that"
- Summarize: "So you're saying..."
- Don't interrupt or finish sentences (unless they clearly want help)

**Respond Appropriately**:
- Acknowledge their feelings
- Offer reassurance
- Provide information they're seeking
- Take action if needed

### Active Listening Techniques for Dementia Care

**When Language Is Difficult to Understand**:
- Focus on the emotion behind the words, not just the words
- Look for the feeling they're expressing (fear, joy, frustration)
- Respond to the emotion: "You seem worried. I'm here with you."
- Don't pretend to understand if you don't

**When They Repeat**:
- Listen to each repetition as if it's the first time
- Respond each time with patience
- Look for what might be driving the repetition (anxiety, unmet need)
- Provide reassurance

**When Stories Don't Make Sense**:
- Don't correct facts or point out inconsistencies
- Follow the emotional thread
- Ask questions about feelings, not facts
- Enjoy the story for what it reveals about what matters to them

### The Power of Presence

Sometimes the most powerful form of active listening is simply being present:
- Sit quietly together
- Hold their hand
- Make eye contact and smile
- Your calm presence communicates "You matter, and I'm here"

## 4. Simple Language

As dementia progresses, the ability to process complex language declines. Simple language makes communication clearer and reduces frustration.

### Principles of Simple Language

**One Idea at a Time**:
- ❌ "After we eat breakfast, we'll get you dressed and then the doctor is coming at 10."
- ✅ "Let's eat breakfast now."

**Short Sentences**:
- Keep sentences under 10 words when possible
- Use simple subject-verb-object structure
- "Mom is here" instead of "Your daughter arrived earlier to visit"

**Concrete, Specific Words**:
- ❌ "Take your medication"
- ✅ "Swallow this pill with water"

- ❌ "We need to go"
- ✅ "We're going to the doctor"

**Familiar Vocabulary**:
- Use words from the person's life and era
- Consider regional terms (soda vs. pop, dinner vs. supper)
- Use their preferred terms (bathroom vs. toilet, couch vs. sofa)

**Avoid Abstract Concepts**:
- ❌ "Try to be more cooperative"
- ✅ "Please sit down"

### Simplifying Questions

**Closed Questions** (Yes/No):
- "Are you cold?"
- "Do you want to eat?"
- "Is this your sweater?"

**Limited Choice Questions** (2 options maximum):
- "Would you like tea or coffee?"
- "Do you want the red shirt or the blue shirt?"

**Avoid Open-Ended Questions**:
- ❌ "What would you like to do today?"
- ✅ "Would you like to go for a walk?"

### Giving Instructions with Simple Language

**Single-Step Instructions**:
- ❌ "Go to the bathroom, wash your hands, and come back for dinner"
- ✅ "Let's go to the bathroom" (then give the next instruction after completing this one)

**Breaking Down Activities**:
Instead of "Get dressed," try:
1. "Here's your shirt"
2. "Put your arm in" (demonstrate)
3. "Now the other arm"
4. "Let's pull it down"

### When to Simplify

- **Early stage**: Mostly normal conversation, simplify only when confusion is evident
- **Middle stage**: Regularly use simple language, one idea at a time
- **Late stage**: Very simple sentences, key words only

## 5. Visual Cues

Visual cues are objects, pictures, or demonstrations that support verbal communication. They're especially helpful as verbal comprehension declines.

### Types of Visual Cues

**Objects**:
- Show the person the object you're talking about
- Hold up their coat while saying "Let's put on your coat"
- Point to food while asking "Would you like more?"
- Show them the toothbrush before saying "Time to brush teeth"

**Demonstrations**:
- Model the action you want them to do
- Pick up a spoon and bring it to your mouth to demonstrate eating
- Brush your own hair while asking them to brush theirs
- Sit down to show them where to sit

**Pictures and Photos**:
- Use photos of family members with names labeled
- Picture schedules showing daily activities
- Photos of meals to help choose food
- Pictures on doors to identify rooms (bathroom, bedroom)

**Labels and Signs**:
- Word labels on doors ("Bathroom," "Kitchen")
- Pictures on drawers (socks, shirts)
- Signs with arrows pointing to important rooms
- Contrast colors to make text stand out

**Written Reminders**:
- Simple notes: "Lunch at noon"
- Memory books with photos and captions
- Calendar with large print
- Lists of daily activities with checkboxes

### Using Visual Cues Effectively

**Timing**:
- Present visual cues at the same time as verbal instructions
- Allow time to look at and process the visual
- Don't rush or overwhelm with too many visuals at once

**Simplicity**:
- Use clear, uncluttered images
- One image or object at a time
- High contrast for easier viewing
- Large, simple pictures work better than complex scenes

**Consistency**:
- Use the same visual cues regularly
- Keep pictures and labels in the same places
- Use familiar objects rather than abstract symbols

### Examples in Daily Life

**Mealtime**:
- Show them the plate of food
- Point to items on the plate
- Demonstrate eating by taking a bite yourself

**Getting Dressed**:
- Lay out clothes in the order they'll be put on
- Show each piece of clothing
- Demonstrate how to put it on

**Bathing**:
- Show them the washcloth
- Demonstrate washing your own face
- Point to body parts to be washed

## 6. Patience

Patience is perhaps the most important communication technique in dementia care. Processing time increases, responses slow, and patience creates space for connection.

### Why Patience Matters

**Processing Delays**:
- The brain takes longer to understand words
- Formulating a response requires more time
- Multiple steps can't be processed quickly
- Rushing creates anxiety and confusion

**Preserved Emotional Awareness**:
- People with dementia can sense when others are impatient
- Your frustration increases their anxiety
- Feeling rushed leads to shutdown or resistance
- Patience communicates respect and care

### Practicing Patience

**Allow Response Time**:
- Ask a question and wait
- Count to 10 (or 20) silently before speaking again
- Resist the urge to fill silence
- Watch for non-verbal signs they're processing

**Slow Down**:
- Move at their pace, not yours
- Build extra time into daily activities
- Expect tasks to take longer than they used to
- Don't schedule back-to-back activities

**Repeat Without Frustration**:
- Expect to repeat information
- Each repetition should be as patient as the first
- Use the same words each time for consistency
- Consider that they might need to hear it several times

**Stay Calm During Delays**:
- Take deep breaths
- Remind yourself this isn't intentional
- Focus on the person, not the task
- Getting frustrated doesn't speed things up

### When Patience Is Challenged

**High-Stress Moments**:
- Getting ready for an appointment
- Medication time
- Meals that are getting cold
- When you're tired or stressed

**Strategies**:
- Build in buffer time
- Lower your expectations
- Take turns with another caregiver if possible
- Remember: The relationship matters more than the schedule

**Self-Care for Patience**:
- Take regular breaks
- Practice stress-reduction techniques
- Get adequate sleep
- Seek support from other caregivers
- Remember that impatience is human—forgive yourself

### What Patience Looks Like

**Physical Signs**:
- Relaxed body posture
- Gentle facial expressions
- Unhurried movements
- Comfortable silence

**Verbal Signs**:
- Speaking slowly and calmly
- Not interrupting
- Repeating without irritation
- Using a consistent, kind tone

**Behavioral Signs**:
- Waiting for responses
- Not rushing tasks
- Allowing time for decision-making
- Adapting to their pace

## 7. Validation Techniques

Validation technique means accepting and validating the person's reality rather than correcting, arguing, or trying to reorient them to your reality. It's based on the principle that the emotions are real, even if the facts aren't accurate.

### The Validation Approach

Developed by Naomi Feil, validation therapy recognizes that:
- The person's feelings are always valid
- Their reality is real to them
- Arguing causes distress without changing their beliefs
- Meeting them in their reality maintains dignity and connection

### Principles of Validation

**Accept Their Reality**:
- If they think they're 30 years old, don't argue
- If they're looking for their mother (who passed away), don't bluntly state she's dead
- If they think they need to go to work, acknowledge the feeling

**Validate Emotions**:
- "You really miss your mother"
- "Work was important to you"
- "You sound worried about that"

**Don't Lie, But Don't Argue**:
- You don't have to agree with false beliefs
- But you don't have to correct them either
- Focus on feelings, not facts

**Respond to the Underlying Need**:
- Looking for mother = need for comfort and security
- Wanting to go to work = need for purpose
- Asking to go home = need for familiarity and safety

### Validation in Practice

**Example 1: "I need to pick up my children from school"**

❌ **Don't say**: "Your children are adults now. You're not picking anyone up."

✅ **Do say**:
- "Tell me about your children"
- "You were always there for them"
- "Being a parent was important to you"
- Then redirect: "Let's have some tea while we look at photos"

**Example 2: "I need to go home"** (when they are home)

❌ **Don't say**: "You ARE home. This is your house."

✅ **Do say**:
- "Tell me about home. What do you miss?"
- "Home is a special place"
- "You're safe here with me"
- Then redirect: "Let's sit in your favorite chair"

**Example 3: "My mother is coming to visit"** (mother deceased)

❌ **Don't say**: "Your mother died 20 years ago. She's not coming."

✅ **Do say**:
- "Your mother is special to you"
- "Tell me about your mother"
- "What was she like?"
- You might say: "She can't visit today, but let's look at her picture"

**Example 4: Accusations** ("You stole my purse!")

❌ **Don't say**: "I did NOT steal your purse! How dare you accuse me!"

✅ **Do say**:
- "Your purse is important to you"
- "Let's look for it together"
- "What does your purse look like?"
- Then help find it without blaming

### When Not to Validate

**Safety Issues**:
- If they believe they can drive safely when they can't
- If they think they don't need supervision
- In these cases, validation of feeling + gentle redirection: "I know you want to drive. That must be frustrating. I'll drive us today."

**Legal/Financial Decisions**:
- Major decisions require capacity assessment
- Validation doesn't mean agreeing to everything

### Benefits of Validation

- Reduces anxiety and agitation
- Preserves dignity
- Maintains connection
- Reduces caregiver-care recipient conflict
- Honors the person's emotional experience
- Prevents catastrophic reactions

## 8. Redirection

Redirection is a technique for gently shifting attention away from a distressing or problematic topic or behavior to something more positive or appropriate.

### When to Use Redirection

**Common Situations**:
- Repetitive questions or stories
- Distressing topics (wanting deceased loved ones, wanting to go home)
- Unsafe requests (wanting to drive, wanting to leave)
- Fixation on something unattainable
- Agitation or anxiety
- Resistance to necessary care

**Not Redirection, but Distraction**:
Redirection isn't about tricking or distracting like you would a toddler. It's about honoring their feelings, then offering an alternative focus.

### Effective Redirection Techniques

**Validate, Then Redirect**:
1. Acknowledge the feeling or concern
2. Briefly validate
3. Suggest an alternative

**Example**:
- Person: "I want to go home"
- You: "I know you miss home. Let's have some tea in the living room"

**Use Their Interests**:
- Redirect to topics or activities they enjoy
- "Speaking of that, would you like to look at photos?"
- "I know you love music. Let's listen to your favorite song"

**Introduce a New Topic**:
- Change subject to something pleasant
- "Look, it's snowing outside!"
- "Did I tell you about the birds I saw this morning?"

**Offer an Activity**:
- "Would you like to help me fold towels?"
- "Let's go for a walk"
- "Want to have a snack?"

**Use Humor** (when appropriate):
- Light, gentle humor can shift mood
- Must be appropriate and not mocking
- Laugh with them, not at them

### Redirection Strategies by Situation

**Repetitive Questions** ("When is lunch?"):
- Answer the first few times
- Then: "Lunch is coming soon. Would you like to help me set the table?"
- Write down the information: "See, it says right here: lunch at noon"

**Wanting to Leave/Go Home**:
- "I know you want to go home. It's not time yet. Let's [activity]"
- Walk with them (the movement may satisfy the urge)
- Show them a comfortable, familiar spot

**Looking for Deceased Loved Ones**:
- "Mom isn't here right now. She loves you very much."
- "Tell me about Mom"
- Redirect to photos or memories

**Repetitive Stories**:
- Listen actively the first several times
- Then: "I love that story. Would you like to look at photos from that time?"

### What Redirection Is NOT

**NOT lying**: You're not making false promises
**NOT invalidating**: You acknowledge feelings first
**NOT dismissing**: You don't ignore their concern
**NOT controlling**: You're offering alternatives, not demanding compliance

### Making Redirection Successful

**Timing**:
- Redirect early before agitation escalates
- Watch for signs of fixation
- Don't wait until they're highly upset

**Body Language**:
- Stay calm and relaxed
- Gentle touch (if they're receptive)
- Lead them physically to new location or activity

**Flexibility**:
- If first redirection doesn't work, try another
- Some days certain topics work better
- Follow their lead

**Environment**:
- Have redirection tools ready (photo albums, music, snacks)
- Keep favorite activities accessible
- Create pleasant spaces to redirect to

## 9. Communication Boards

Communication boards are visual tools that help people with limited verbal skills express needs, feelings, and preferences. They become increasingly important in middle and late-stage dementia.

### What Are Communication Boards?

Communication boards display pictures, symbols, words, or photos that the person can point to in order to communicate. They can be:
- Physical boards (poster, binder)
- Digital (tablet)
- Books or flip charts
- Individual cards

### Types of Communication Boards

**Basic Needs Board**:
Pictures representing:
- Thirsty (glass of water)
- Hungry (plate of food)
- Bathroom (toilet)
- Cold/hot (thermometer)
- Pain (body outline)
- Tired (bed)

**Feelings/Emotions Board**:
Faces showing:
- Happy
- Sad
- Angry
- Scared
- Worried
- Tired
- Content

**Activities Board**:
Pictures of:
- Music (headphones)
- TV (television)
- Walk (shoes or outdoor scene)

- Point to pictures as you say the words
- Demonstrate how it works

**Make It Accessible**:
- Keep it where they can see and reach it
- Have multiple boards in different rooms
- Keep it in a consistent location
- Take it with you to appointments

**Teach Caregivers**:
- All caregivers should know how to use it
- Explain the system to new helpers
- Include instructions on the board itself

**Combine with Other Communication**:
- Point to pictures as you speak
- Use pictures to confirm understanding ("You want water? This one?")
- Watch for body language confirming the choice

### Technology Options

**Communication Apps**:
- TouchChat
- Proloquo2Go
- MyTalkTools Mobile
- CoughDrop
- LetMeTalk (free)

**Tablet Considerations**:
- Large screen (10+ inches)
- Simple interface
- Locked to communication app
- Protective case
- Accessible location

### Beyond Basic Boards

**Photo Albums as Communication Tools**:
- Family members with names
- Important life events
- Favorite places
- Beloved pets
- Can prompt memories and conversation

**Daily Schedule Board**:

- Pictures for each activity
- Move a marker to show current time
- Reduces anxiety about what's coming next

**Choice Boards**:
- Morning routine (bath or shower?)
- Clothing options
- Meal choices
- Activity options

### When Communication Boards Help Most

- Middle to late-stage dementia
- After stroke affecting speech
- When frustration over communication is high
- When basic needs aren't being met
- In healthcare settings (ER, hospital)
- With multiple caregivers who need consistency

## 10. Body Language

Body language includes posture, gestures, facial expressions, and physical distance. In dementia care, you must both "read" their body language and be aware of your own.

### Reading Their Body Language

**Signs of Comfort**:
- Relaxed facial muscles
- Soft eyes, maybe smiling
- Open posture
- Sitting back comfortably
- Leaning toward you
- Gentle reaching out
- Calm breathing

**Signs of Discomfort**:
- Furrowed brow
- Tense jaw or lips
- Crossed arms
- Pulling away
- Fidgeting
- Pacing
- Rapid breathing

**Signs of Pain**:
- Grimacing
- Guarding a body part
- Hitting or pushing away when touched in specific area
- Crying or moaning
- Restlessness
- Drawn facial features

**Signs of Fear or Anxiety**:
- Wide eyes
- Startled reactions
- Withdrawal
- Defensive postures
- Attempting to leave
- Gripping furniture or people

**Signs of Anger or Agitation**:
- Red face
- Clenched fists
- Aggressive gestures
- Rigid posture
- Invading others' space
- Rapid movements

**Signs of Sadness**:
- Downcast eyes
- Slumped posture
- Slow movements
- Tears
- Lack of expression
- Withdrawal

### Using Your Body Language

**Approaching**:
- Approach slowly from the front
- Come to their eye level
- Maintain comfortable distance (arm's length)
- Have an open, relaxed posture
- Smile gently

**During Interaction**:
- Face them directly
- Maintain gentle eye contact
- Keep your body language calm
- Use natural gestures
- Nod to show understanding
- Mirror their energy level (if they're calm, you're calm)

**Physical Touch**:
- Always ask or signal before touching
- Approach from front where they can see your hand coming
- Start with neutral areas (hand, shoulder)
- Avoid sudden or rough touch
- Use gentle, slow movements
- Stop if they pull away

**What to Avoid**:
- Standing over them (intimidating)
- Approaching from behind (startling)
- Crossing your arms (defensive)
- Pointing accusingly
- Moving too quickly
- Showing impatience through body language (eye-rolling, sighing, checking watch)

### Body Language as Communication

**When Words Fail**:
In late-stage dementia, body language may be the primary communication method:
- A smile says "You're safe"
- A gentle touch says "I'm here"
- Eye contact says "I see you"
- Sitting quietly together says "Your presence matters"

**Responsive Behaviors**:
What we call "behaviors" are often body language communicating:
- Pacing = anxiety, need for movement, searching
- Pushing away = fear, pain, overstimulation
- Hitting during care = fear, pain, feeling violated
- Wandering toward door = need to go somewhere, need for purpose

### Body Language Through the Stages

**Early Stage**:
- Body language mostly typical
- May see some uncertainty or confusion in expressions
- Posture may show anxiety about cognitive changes

**Middle Stage**:
- Body language becomes more important as words fail
- May have more exaggerated expressions
- Posture and gestures compensate for lost words

**Late Stage**:
- Body language is primary communication
- Facial expressions show feelings
- Posture indicates comfort or distress
- Reaching, pulling away, or hitting are communication

### Teaching Others About Body Language

**For Family Members**:
- Point out what their body language is telling you
- Model calm body language
- Explain that the person can sense tension

**For Professional Caregivers**:
- Train in reading non-verbal cues
- Practice maintaining open, calm body language
- Debrief after difficult interactions about what body language said

### Cultural Considerations

Remember that body language varies by culture:
- Eye contact expectations differ
- Personal space norms vary
- Touch may be more or less acceptable
- Certain gestures have different meanings
- Honor the person's cultural background

## Communication Through the Stages

Communication strategies must adapt as dementia progresses.

### Early Stage Communication

**What's Happening**:
- Word-finding difficulties
- Repetition
- Losing train of thought
- Mostly intact conversation ability

**Communication Strategies**:
- Mostly normal conversation
- Allow extra time for word-finding
- Gently provide words if they're struggling
- Don't correct minor mistakes
- Active listening
- Patience with repetition
- Include them in decisions and conversations

**Support Tools**:
- Memory aids (calendar, notes)
- Lists and reminders
- Photos with labels

### Middle Stage Communication

**What's Happening**:
- Significant word-finding difficulty
- Mixing up words
- Difficulty with complex language
- Reduced vocabulary
- Repetitive questions/stories
- May confuse people or time

**Communication Strategies**:
- Simple language (short sentences, one idea at a time)

- Visual cues and demonstrations
- Validation techniques
- Redirection
- More non-verbal communication
- Focus on feelings, not facts

**Support Tools**:
- Communication boards for basic needs
- Picture schedules
- Labels on items and rooms
- Photo albums for conversation starters

### Late Stage Communication

**What's Happening**:
- Very limited or no verbal communication
- May not respond to questions

- Emotional awareness often remains

**Communication Strategies**:
- Use body language and touch
- Speak in short, simple phrases
- Provide running commentary on care ("I'm washing your face now")
- Use tone of voice to convey care
- Read their body language for needs
- Don't assume they can't hear or understand
- Presence is communication

**Support Tools**:
- Communication boards (point to their needs)
- Pain assessment tools
- Comfort objects
- Familiar music

## Special Communication Situations

### Declining an Activity

When they don't want to do something (bathe, take medication, eat):

1. **Don't force** (unless it's urgent safety issue)
2. **Validate**: "I know you don't want to right now"
3. **Wait**: Try again in 15-30 minutes
4. **Reframe**: "Let's get cleaned up so you feel fresh" instead of "Bath time"
5. **Offer choice**: "Bath or shower?"

### Responding to Repetitive Questions

**Strategy**:
- Answer patiently the first several times
- Look for anxiety beneath the question
- Address the underlying concern
- Write down the answer
- Redirect to activity

### Communicating Bad News

Sometimes you must communicate difficult information (death, illness, move):

**Guidelines**:
- Consider whether they need to know
- If they won't remember, weigh the benefit vs. distress
- Be honest but gentle
- Keep it simple
- Allow them to feel their feelings
- Provide comfort and reassurance
- May need to tell them multiple times as they forget and re-grieve

### When They Don't Recognize You

**This is emotionally painful, but**:

- Narrate what you're doing
- Don't take silence personally

### Challenge: They speak in language that doesn't make sense

**Solutions**:
- Listen for emotional content
- Respond to feelings, not words
- "That sounds important to you"
- Don't point out that it doesn't make sense
- Look for patterns (certain words/themes)

### Challenge: They're hostile or accusatory in communication

**Solutions**:
- Don't argue or defend
- Stay calm
- Validate feelings
- Look for unmet need (pain, fear)
- Change environment or caregiver
- Document patterns

### Challenge: You need to give complex information (new medication, upcoming move)

- Use visual aids
- Written information they can refer to
- Involve them in whatever way possible
- Be prepared to repeat many times

## Key Takeaways

1. **Communication is about connection, not just information exchange**. The goal is to maintain the relationship and preserve dignity.

2. **How you communicate is as important as what you say**. Tone, body language, and facial expressions carry more weight than words.

3. **Their reality is real to them**. Validation techniques work better than correction or reorientation.

4. **Patience is the foundation** of all effective communication in dementia care. Processing takes time.

5. **Simple language reduces frustration**. One idea, short sentences, concrete words.

6. **Visual cues bridge the gap** when words fail. Show, don't just tell.

7. **Body language speaks louder than words**, especially in later stages. Yours and theirs.

8. **Active listening shows respect** and helps you understand the person behind the words.

9. **Redirection maintains dignity** while addressing problematic behaviors or topics.

10. **Communication boards provide voice** when verbal skills are lost.

11. **Non-verbal communication remains powerful** throughout the disease. A touch, smile, or calm presence communicates care.

12. **Adapt your strategies** as dementia progresses. What works in early stages won't work in late stages.

13. **Focus on emotions, not facts**. Getting the facts right matters less than addressing feelings.

14. **You are the communication expert**. The person with dementia can't adapt to you—you must adapt to them.

15. **Effective communication reduces behaviors**. Many challenging behaviors stem from communication frustration.
