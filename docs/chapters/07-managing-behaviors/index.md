# Managing Challenging Behaviors

## Summary

This chapter addresses the challenging behaviors commonly associated with dementia and provides strategies for understanding and managing them. You will learn about sundowning (increased confusion in late afternoon/evening), wandering, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, delusions, and repetitive behaviors. The chapter also covers sleep disturbances and catastrophic reactions (sudden emotional outbursts). Each behavior is explained in context of the underlying brain changes, helping caregivers respond with compassion and effective strategies rather than frustration. Understanding that these behaviors are symptoms of the disease, not intentional actions, is crucial for providing quality care.
