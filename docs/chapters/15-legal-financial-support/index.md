# Chapter 15: Legal, Financial, and Support Resources

## Introduction

A dementia diagnosis affects not just the individual but the entire support system—family, finances, legal matters, healthcare, and community connections. Navigating this complex landscape can feel overwhelming, especially when you're also providing daily care and managing emotions.

This comprehensive chapter serves as your resource guide through the essential legal, financial, and support systems you'll need throughout the dementia journey. From establishing legal documents early in the disease to choosing care facilities later, from understanding Medicare coverage to finding emotional support—this chapter provides practical information to help you make informed decisions and access the resources available to you.

**The Importance of Early Planning**: Many legal and financial decisions are best made early in the disease when the person with dementia can still participate in the planning. Don't wait for a crisis to address these critical issues.

## Part I: Legal Planning and Documents

Proper legal planning protects the person with dementia, empowers trusted individuals to make decisions when needed, and prevents family conflict. These documents should be established as early as possible after diagnosis.

### 1. Power of Attorney (POA)

A Power of Attorney is a legal document that allows someone (the "agent" or "attorney-in-fact") to make decisions and take actions on behalf of another person (the "principal").

**Types of Power of Attorney**:

**General Power of Attorney**:
- Broad authority over financial and legal matters
- Can handle banking, bills, taxes, property
- Typically ends if person becomes incapacitated
- Not ideal for dementia planning

**Durable Power of Attorney**:
- Remains in effect even after incapacitation
- "Durable" is the key word for dementia planning
- Essential for managing affairs throughout disease
- **This is what you want for dementia care**

**Springing Power of Attorney**:
- Only goes into effect upon specific event (usually incapacitation)
- Requires certification of incapacity (can cause delays)
- May be challenged more easily
- Less commonly used than durable POA

**When to Establish**:
- As soon as possible after diagnosis
- While person still has legal capacity
- Before moderate-stage dementia
- Ideally along with other advance directives

**What the Agent Can Do**:
- Pay bills and manage bank accounts
- File taxes
- Manage investments
- Buy, sell, or manage property
- Apply for government benefits
- Handle insurance claims
- Make legal decisions
- Hire professionals (accountants, lawyers)

**Choosing an Agent**:
- Someone trustworthy and responsible
- Financially literate
- Available and willing
- Able to keep records and communicate with family
- Often a spouse, adult child, or trusted friend
- Can name co-agents (act together) or successor agents (backups)

**Legal Requirements**:
- Person must have legal capacity at time of signing
- Must be signed by the principal
- Must be witnessed (requirements vary by state)
- Often requires notarization
- Some states require specific forms
- Check state-specific requirements

**Cost**:
- DIY forms: $0-$50 (available online or office supply stores)
- Attorney preparation: $200-$400
- **Worth hiring attorney to ensure it's done correctly**

**Important Considerations**:
- POA ends at death (estate then managed by executor/will)
- Agent has fiduciary duty (must act in principal's best interest)
- Agent must keep records of all transactions
- Can be revoked while principal has capacity
- Original documents should be kept safe; provide copies as needed
- Financial institutions may require their own forms in addition to POA

### 2. Healthcare Proxy (Healthcare Power of Attorney)

A Healthcare Proxy (also called Healthcare Power of Attorney or Medical POA) designates someone to make medical decisions when the person cannot.

**What It Is**:
- Legal document naming a healthcare agent
- Agent makes medical decisions if person is incapacitated
- Separate from financial power of attorney
- Different from living will (which states wishes, not who decides)

**When It Activates**:
- When person cannot communicate their wishes
- When doctor certifies person lacks capacity to make medical decisions
- Temporarily during medical emergencies
- Permanently in later stages of dementia

**What the Healthcare Agent Can Do**:
- Consent to or refuse medical treatment
- Choose doctors and facilities
- Access medical records
- Make end-of-life decisions (if authority granted)
- Decide about hospitalization
- Make decisions about surgery, medications, procedures

**Choosing a Healthcare Agent**:
- Someone who knows your values and wishes
- Able to advocate for you
- Can handle stress and make difficult decisions
- Available and willing
- Comfortable discussing end-of-life issues
- Often spouse, adult child, trusted friend
- Name alternate agents (successors)

**How to Prepare**:
1. Discuss your values and wishes with chosen agent
2. Cover specific scenarios (CPR, feeding tubes, ventilators)
3. Complete healthcare proxy form (state-specific)
4. Sign in presence of witnesses/notary (state requirements vary)
5. Give copies to agent, doctors, hospital, family
6. Keep original in accessible location
7. Bring copy to all medical appointments

**Important Discussions to Have**:
- Quality of life vs. length of life priorities
- Acceptable medical interventions
- Religious/spiritual considerations
- CPR preferences
- Artificial nutrition/hydration
- Ventilator use
- Hospitalization vs. comfort care
- Organ donation
- Autopsy preferences

**Legal Requirements**:
- Person must have capacity at signing
- State-specific forms (check requirements)
- Witnesses required (typically 2, not including agent)
- Some states require notarization
- May need separate form for mental health decisions

**Differences from Living Will**:
- Healthcare Proxy: Names WHO decides
- Living Will: States WHAT you want
- Best to have both

### 3. Living Will

A Living Will is a written statement of your wishes regarding medical treatment in specific situations, particularly end-of-life care.

**What It Is**:
- Legal document stating your healthcare wishes
- Focuses on end-of-life and serious illness scenarios
- Provides guidance when you can't communicate
- Instructs doctors and family about your preferences
- Also called "Advance Directive for Healthcare"

**What It Typically Addresses**:

**Life-Sustaining Treatments**:
- Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
- Mechanical ventilation (breathing machine)
- Artificial nutrition and hydration (feeding tubes)
- Dialysis
- Antibiotics for infections
- Blood transfusions
- Organ donation

**Situations Covered**:
- Terminal illness with no hope of recovery
- Permanent unconsciousness/vegetative state
- Advanced dementia with complications
- Conditions where burdens outweigh benefits

**What You Can Specify**:

"If I am in a terminal condition with no reasonable hope of recovery, I want":
- All life-sustaining treatment
- Life-sustaining treatment for trial period
- Comfort care only (no life-prolonging measures)
- Specific treatments accepted or refused

**Creating a Living Will**:
1. Consider your values, beliefs, and priorities
2. Discuss with family, healthcare proxy, doctor
3. Use state-specific form or attorney
4. Be as specific or general as you prefer
5. Sign with required witnesses/notarization
6. Distribute copies to healthcare proxy, doctors, hospital, family
7. Keep original accessible
8. Review and update periodically

**Important Considerations**:
- Must have capacity when creating
- Can be changed or revoked at any time (while you have capacity)
- Doctors are legally required to follow it
- More specific instructions are clearer but less flexible
- Balance specificity with allowing agent to adapt to situations
- Discuss with doctor to ensure medically appropriate

**Limitations**:
- Cannot cover every possible scenario
- Medical situations may not match those described
- Healthcare proxy makes decisions in situations not covered
- Some treatments may not be available or appropriate

**Five Wishes** (popular living will document):
- Available at FiveWishes.org
- Covers medical, personal, emotional, and spiritual needs
- Legal in most states
- Easy-to-understand language
- Costs $5

### 4. Advance Directives

Advance Directives is an umbrella term for legal documents that communicate your healthcare wishes if you become unable to make decisions.

### 6. Conservatorship

Conservatorship is a legal proceeding where the court appoints someone (the conservator) to manage the financial affairs of a person (the conservatee) who cannot manage their own finances.

**What Is Conservatorship**:
- Court-appointed financial management
- Similar to guardianship but focuses on finances

**What Medicaid Covers**:
- Nursing home care
- Some assisted living (in some states)
- Home and community-based services (varies by state)
- Medical services
- Does NOT typically cover memory care unless in nursing home

**Medicaid vs. Medicare**:

## Part IV: Emotional and Caregiver Support

Caring for someone with dementia takes an emotional toll. Support for caregivers is essential—you can't pour from an empty cup.

### 16. Grief

Grief is the natural response to loss. In dementia care, grief is complex and ongoing.

**Types of Loss in Dementia**:
- Loss of the person you knew
- Loss of relationship and companionship
- Loss of shared activities and interests
- Loss of future plans and dreams
- Loss of role (spouse, parent)
- Loss of independence
- Loss of identity (for person with dementia)

**Stages of Grief** (not linear):
- Denial
- Anger
- Bargaining
- Depression
- Acceptance

**Important**: These stages aren't a checklist or timeline. Grief is messy, non-linear, individual.

**Unique Aspects of Grief in Dementia**:

**Ambiguous Loss**:
- Person is physically present but psychologically absent
- Neither fully here nor gone
- Cannot achieve closure
- Makes grieving confusing and complicated

**Disenfranchised Grief**:
- Others may not recognize your grief ("But they're still alive")
- Society may not validate your loss
- May feel you shouldn't grieve while person is alive
- Lack of social support for this type of grief

**Chronic Sorrow**:
- Ongoing, periodic episodes of grief
- Triggered by milestones, memories, progression
- Cycles of grief throughout disease course
- Normal response to prolonged loss

**Anticipatory Grief** (see next section)

**Coping with Grief**:
- Acknowledge and accept your grief
- Allow yourself to feel emotions
- Talk about your feelings (therapist, support group, trusted friend)
- Honor memories while accepting current reality
- Practice self-care
- Seek support
- Remember: grief is love with nowhere to go

**When to Seek Professional Help**:
- Grief interferes with daily functioning
- Depression or anxiety
- Suicidal thoughts
- Unable to care for person with dementia
- Prolonged, intense grief without improvement
- Substance use to cope

**Supporting Others' Grief**:
- Acknowledge their loss
- Listen without trying to fix
- Avoid platitudes ("At least they don't suffer")
- Offer practical help
- Remember special dates
- Continue support over time

### 17. Anticipatory Grief

Anticipatory grief is grieving before death occurs, in anticipation of loss to come.

**What Is Anticipatory Grief**:
- Mourning losses that have occurred and those yet to come
- Grief for the future you won't have
- Sadness about anticipated death
- Common in dementia caregiving
- Not just about death but ongoing losses

**Why Anticipatory Grief Happens in Dementia**:
- Progressive disease with predictable decline
- Time to anticipate future losses
- Watching person disappear gradually
- Awareness of trajectory toward death
- Many small losses over time

**Manifestations**:
- Sadness and crying
- Anger or irritability
- Anxiety about the future
- Guilt (for feeling grief while person is alive)
- Social withdrawal

- Difficulty concentrating

**Benefits of Anticipatory Grief**:
- Opportunity to prepare emotionally
- Time to say things you want to say
- Chance to resolve conflicts
- Make end-of-life plans
- Build support systems
- Begin processing loss before death
- Potentially easier bereavement after death

**Challenges**:
- Exhaustion from prolonged grief
- Others may not understand
- Guilt about grieving while person is alive
- May create distance from person ("protective distancing")
- Emotional rollercoaster
- No clear endpoint (until death)

**Coping with Anticipatory Grief**:
- Acknowledge it's normal and valid
- Balance living in moment with anticipating future
- Talk about feelings
- Join support group (others who understand)
- Individual counseling
- Self-care is essential
- Focus on what you can control
- Make meaning of the time remaining

- Say what needs to be said

**Does Anticipatory Grief Make Death Easier?**:
- Research shows mixed results
- May help in some ways (preparation, support in place)
- Doesn't necessarily reduce grief after death
- Post-death grief is still real and valid
- Each person's experience is unique

**Anticipatory Grief vs. Giving Up**:
- Grieving ≠ giving up
- Can grieve and still provide excellent care
- Can be sad about future while present in moment
- Not incompatible with hope and love
