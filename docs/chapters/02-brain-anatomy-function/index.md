# Brain Anatomy and Function

## Summary

This chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of brain structure and function essential for understanding how dementia affects the brain. You will learn about neurons, neurotransmitters, and how brain cells communicate through synapses and neural networks. The chapter covers the major brain regions including the cerebral cortex and its four lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital), as well as specialized structures like the hippocampus. Understanding neuroplasticity and the distinction between gray and white matter will help you grasp how dementia causes neurodegeneration and impacts cognitive abilities.
