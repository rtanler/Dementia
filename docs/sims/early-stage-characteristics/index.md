# Early-Stage Dementia Characteristics

## Overview

This interactive wheel diagram provides a comprehensive visual overview of early-stage dementia characteristics across five key domains: Cognitive Abilities, Daily Function, Personality, Behavior, and Mood. The visualization helps families and caregivers understand what abilities are impaired versus what remains intact, promoting a balanced perspective that focuses on remaining capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, learners will be able to:

- **Understand** the characteristics of early-stage dementia across cognitive, functional, personality, behavioral, and mood domains (Bloom Level 2)
- **Explain** the distinction between impaired and preserved abilities in each domain
- **Describe** specific examples of how early-stage dementia manifests in daily life
- **Compare** early-stage dementia with moderate and late-stage progression

## How to Use

1. **Explore the Wheel**: Click on any of the five colored sections (petals) to view detailed information about that domain
2. **View Details**: Each section shows:
   - Impaired abilities (what's affected)
   - Preserved abilities (what remains intact)
   - Degree of impairment meter (showing mild impairment in early stage)
3. **Show Examples**: Click the "Show Examples" button to reveal concrete scenarios illustrating how impairments appear in real life
4. **Compare Stages**: Click "Compare Stages" to see how early-stage dementia differs from moderate and late stages
5. **Reset View**: Click "Reset View" to deselect the current section and start over

## Key Domains

### Cognitive Abilities (Orange)
- **Impaired**: Recent memory, learning new information, complex planning
- **Preserved**: Remote memory, basic reasoning, familiar knowledge
- **Example**: Can remember childhood home address but forgets conversation from this morning

### Daily Function (Blue)
- **Impaired**: Managing finances, complex cooking, medication management without reminders
- **Preserved**: Self-care (bathing, dressing), eating, basic household tasks
- **Example**: Can shower independently but needs help balancing checkbook

### Personality (Purple)
- **Changes**: May be more anxious, less spontaneous, more rigid about routines
- **Preserved**: Core personality recognizable, values generally intact
- **Example**: Still friendly but less interested in trying new restaurants

### Behavior (Green)
- **Changes**: More repetition, some social withdrawal, difficulty with new situations
- **Preserved**: Generally cooperative, able to engage socially, follows most social norms
- **Example**: Asks "What time is dinner?" multiple times but follows through appropriately

### Mood (Yellow)
- **Changes**: May have depression, anxiety about decline, frustration
- **Preserved**: Can experience full range of emotions, joy in positive experiences
- **Example**: Aware of memory problems and feels sad about losing abilities

## Key Message

**In early-stage dementia, much remains intact. Focus on what the person CAN do, not just what they can't.**

This perspective helps:
- Maintain the person's dignity and self-esteem
- Identify opportunities for meaningful engagement
- Support remaining abilities rather than highlighting losses
- Guide appropriate levels of assistance and support

## Interactive Features

## Educational Context

This MicroSim supports understanding of:
- The heterogeneous nature of dementia progression
- The importance of person-centered care approaches
- How to assess functional capabilities across multiple domains
- The balance between independence and necessary support in early-stage dementia

## Technical Details

- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with SVG
- **Visualization Type**: Interactive wheel diagram (petal design)
- **Interactivity**: Click-to-expand sections, hover effects, modal comparisons
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Color-coded sections with text labels

## Lesson Plan

### Target Audience

- Healthcare professionals (nurses, CNAs, social workers)
- Family caregivers of individuals with early-stage dementia
- Students in gerontology, nursing, or healthcare programs
- Support group facilitators

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of dementia as a progressive neurodegenerative condition
- Familiarity with activities of daily living (ADLs) terminology

### Learning Activities

1. **Exploration Activity** (15 minutes)
   - Have learners click through each of the five domains
   - Ask them to note patterns: What types of abilities are preserved vs. impaired?
   - Discuss why remote memory might be preserved while recent memory is impaired

2. **Scenario Application** (20 minutes)
   - Present real-world scenarios involving individuals with early-stage dementia
   - Have learners identify which domain(s) are affected
   - Discuss appropriate support strategies that maintain independence

3. **Stage Comparison Activity** (15 minutes)
   - Use the "Compare Stages" feature to view progression across stages
   - Discuss how care needs change as dementia progresses
   - Identify when additional support or safety measures become necessary

4. **Care Planning Exercise** (20 minutes)
   - Based on preserved abilities in early stage, have learners develop a person-centered care plan
   - Focus on maintaining dignity, independence, and quality of life
   - Identify activities that can still be enjoyed with minimal adaptation

### Assessment

- **Formative**: During exploration, ask learners to explain why certain abilities remain preserved in early-stage dementia
- **Summative**: Present a case study and have learners identify the stage of dementia and appropriate interventions based on impaired vs. preserved abilities
- **Application**: Have learners create a one-page guide for families explaining what to expect in early-stage dementia, emphasizing remaining capabilities

### Discussion Questions

1. Why is it important to focus on what remains intact rather than only on deficits?
2. How might awareness of remaining abilities influence communication strategies with individuals in early-stage dementia?
3. What ethical considerations arise when balancing independence with safety in early-stage dementia?
4. How can understanding the five domains help with care planning and resource allocation?
