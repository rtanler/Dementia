## Using the Viewer

1. **Search for Concepts**: Start typing in the search box to find concepts. Click on a result to focus on that node.

2. **Filter by Category**: Use the category checkboxes in the sidebar to show or hide groups of related concepts. Use "Check All" or "Uncheck All" for bulk operations.

3. **Navigate the Graph**:
   - Drag to pan around the graph
   - Scroll to zoom in and out
   - Click on a node to select it and highlight its connections
   - Click the hamburger menu (☰) to collapse/expand the sidebar

4. **View Statistics**: The sidebar shows counts of visible nodes, edges, and foundational concepts.

## Graph Structure

- **Foundational Concepts** (scattered throughout): Prerequisites with no dependencies (Brain, Cognition, Age-Related Risk, Body Language)
- **Advanced Concepts**: Topics that build on multiple prerequisites
- **Edges**: Arrows point from a concept to its prerequisites

The graph uses a force-directed layout that positions related concepts near each other.
