## Design Principles

1. **Even Distribution**: Categories designed to distribute ~15-20 concepts each across 200 total concepts
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each category has distinct scope to minimize ambiguity
3. **Pedagogical Grouping**: Categories reflect natural learning modules and topic areas
4. **Practical Organization**: Aligns with the 20-module structure of the course description

## Usage Notes

- Concepts assigned to best-fit category based on primary focus
- Some concepts may have secondary relevance to other categories
- MISC category available for concepts without clear categorization
- Color coding in visualization will help distinguish categories
